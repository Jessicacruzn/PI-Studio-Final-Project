6,6,EJWyA5wpdVMji1j4TwSZqQ,kxX2SOes4o-D3ZQBkiMRfA,13,"After a long hiatus from reviewing I have awaken from my 6 mouth yelp hibernation and my tummies a grumbles with an insatiable hunger for the cacophonous symphony of flavor that is Indian food. Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entr√©es like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios.

Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I'm late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn't cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn't a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience. It was pricey but you pay for what you get.",2017-03-03 21:27:03,Milktooth,534 Virginia Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46203,39.7591692208,-86.146494347,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,0,1

Service is top notch although not terribly fast. Expect to wait awhile for a coffee drink other than brewed coffee but it will be worth the wait. 

Love the building. Love that the menu changes regularly although sometimes I miss an old favorite.

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  

I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  

If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be ""politely declined"" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. 

They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.

Also had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don't have to get a full order like many places!

The rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it?

However, once you order and wait (for a bit despite the slow Tuesday afternoon), the taste is so worth it. My table got the berry pancakes, the savory pancakes, and the grilled cheese with truffles.

Drip coffee was the best coffee I've had for months. Maybe I do need to find something else other than Starbucks. 

Lamb Patty Melt was a little hard to grab so I ate them as a toast + the rest of the sandwich. It has the right amount of lamb flavor and the bread was awesome. So was the fried egg.

We are seated promptly and our waitress took our drink and appetizer order.  A short time later,  our drinks and appetizers arrived. The drinks were great and the guac with chips was fantastic.   

Our waitress took our dinner order and we patiently waited for our food.  The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!

We asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  ""hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?""  We said, ""no"" and our waitress said, ""I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.""  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  

We waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager. After we stated we hadn't, she proceeded to call the manager again and check on our food.

When the manager arrived at our table, it was the same lady who brought the chips and guac! She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. 

We explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. 

At least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.

The food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive.

All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.

The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of saut√©ed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce.

I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just ordered a cup of gumbo.  It was decent but only had chicken and sausage inside, and I really thought it could use a bit of seafood to round out the flavor.  The kids liked their food off the kids menu pretty well, although they should offer a marinara sauce option for the noodles (my young daughter wasn't so excited about butter sauce on her noodles).

My sisters friend had a shrimp po boy with fries. After half a dozen oysters I started to feel nauseous. I didn't want to waste any oysters so I suffered though the first dozen. My sister has a strong stomach and finish 1.5 dozen. I couldn't eat anymore. The gumbo was terrible. It had no flavor, it was so tiny for 7 dollars(we had way better gumbo at another place the day after for way less). We had a taste of the po boy as well. It was just ok. My sisters friend didn't finish it either. The fries came fresh out the freezer I'm sure. Dry and scrawny little things. Should've just gone to French quarter and ate at one of the other places.

I ate at this restaurant many years ago when it first opened and it was not impressive, which was strange as we used to dine in the old buffet which was across from this one, and that was always 4 to 5 stars. 

I didn't eat here for a long time, then heard it was good again, tried it and agreed. I ate here 2 more times and both times were 4-5 stars, that is if you got the dishes that always look the best and the ones you like.

Tonight really was impressive, we were quickly sat, and served, I went out to get a plate and saw the mushroom ravioli and decide to load up, I got about 8 to 10 of them, and most places that would be all you get for $18 (probably a couple less raviolis too), but then I added tortellini, a small serving of lasagna, a loaded baked potato, fresh medium rare prime, and grabbed my seat. Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent! 

I was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp. Again, all 5 star dishes. I was very shocked to have so many different dishes on such a high level! 

Service was great, all plates quickly cleared, server was available anytime for drinks, napkins, etc. 

Last I did desert, I again went for a belly buster consisting of cheesecake, butter finger something, flan, and mint chocolate chip gelato.

It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.

The best dish there I would say was roasted duck - yup, Chinese dish for some reason. Steamed fish was okay too. But the meat (forgot whether it's prime rib or tritip) was super dry and hard to chew. Salad ingredients were not very fresh. Mussel, crab legs were not fresh at all. Desserts were all either too sweet or having some strange taste..

151,213,YcLXh-3UC9y6YFAI9xxzPQ,oBhJuukGRqPVvYBfTkhuZA,0,"The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before.

155,217,A09epXm264sxA6p_k8vWPA,oBhJuukGRqPVvYBfTkhuZA,0,"On this most-recent visit to Square 1682, we noticed the menu changed, removing my main draw to the restaurant: the black bean burger. The falafel sandwich that took its place was served on a rather hard bun, rather than traditional pita, which smushed the falafel as you ate and generally overwhelmed the flavors of the tzatziki sauce. (There are plenty of delicious falafel spots in the area that quite simply do it better.)

The drop in rating comes from the ""Express Lunch"" taking 45 minutes to get to the table (we had 8 people, most of whom ordered the Express Lunch, assuming it would be quicker than the regular menu). 45 minutes is not express and not at all useful when lunching on a time limit. It would've been nice if the server had noted that because Express Lunches are served all 3 courses together, they do not come out as prepared (they're held under a heating lamp till all pieces are ready) and therefore it might be faster for a large group to order off the regular menu. We saw other groups (including some of our colleagues) come and go in the time it took for us to get our food.

I still like the space, as it's quieter than many restaurants, so you can hear one another more easily, but this latest experience took a hit on my recommending it for future meals.

My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch, which was divine.  If you are of age, order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  

They bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.

I was walking back to my car from ACME, when I spotted a fisherman who was parked and selling his fresh shrimp catch to a chef out on the street.  I took one quick look at his catch and found the most wonderful looking jumbo shrimp I had ever laid eyes on.  Not your standard jumbo, but real JUMBO.  Huge tasty looking shrimp!

I was compelled--even though I had just gorged myself on chargrilled oysters and a po'boy--to inquire about these shrimp of his.  I asked him, ""excuse me, sir, where is the absolute best place to eat those shrimp of yours around here?""

His answer: ""Mr B's, you have to try the BBQ shrimp there for sure""

Who dat?  Mr B's dat.  My convinced my coworker (which wasn't to difficult) to come with me to try the BBQ shrimp.  We quickly sat at the bar, as we had already eaten lunch, and requested an order of BBQ shrimp to share.

When the shrimp came to us, and we took that first bite (after peeling the shrimp, of course), we found ourselves in decapod heaven.  They were served swimming (no pun intended) in a delectable buttery/spicy sauce, which was truly amazing.  The smokey and spicy flavors of the sauce were infused into the shrimp, which is truly no small feat.  The best part about a sauce like this is that it seems to build in nuance and intensity with each bite.  Each shrimp, as a result, seemed better than the one just before it.

I was so amazed, that I returned the very next day for another order of BBQ shrimp, to be split with a different friend.  I take great pleasure in sharing the things I truly enjoy with friends, and what better way to do that than over a bowl of BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's?",2010-10-06 08:18:12,Mr. B's Bistro,201 Royal St,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9543868,-90.0683629,4.0,1,2,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

When you walk in you can tell it is slightly more upscale than its surroundings.  It's near the bourbon street area, and most of that are bars and entertainment.

Mr. B's is that white table cloth kind of place and the servers all look like they are in suits.  The atmosphere is nice, and fairly casual.

The food is pretty good.  They have a pork and fig entree...the pork was very tender, but there wasn't enough of the fig to really make a difference.  There is also a pork chop entree that is really good, but not as tender as the pork and fig.

The bbq shrimp was really good....they give you a bib so you don't splatter on yourself.

We made a reservation and specifically told the receptionist that we will have a baby in a stroller. When arriving right on time for our 6:30 reservation on Friday 07/17/15 the hostess had this mean face. I informed her that we had a reservation and provided her the information. In a not so friendly tone she asked me if everyone was present. We informed her no, but they were on their way. The door to the restaurant is one of those spiral hotel lobby doors. My dad didn't know how to get the stroller inside. The male hostess walked to the door and was informing my father to go around. When I saw they were here, I walked up to the mean women and informed her my party was complete. She watched with an even uglier face on as my father walked in with the stroller. She ignored me as she was watching him and I repeated twice that my party was complete. She finally decided to talk to me and informed me that the stroller cannot go by our table. I then replied that I specifically informed the receptionist about the baby. At that moment the hostess raised her hand to my face to tell me to stop. I was shocked and wanted to hit her hand out of my face. However, being in a nice place I kept it in and just walked away. The male hostess sat us at a table that had booth seating. He pulled the table out for some of us to slide in and he walked away! So the rest of the party pushed the table back. I then was telling my family how shocked I am about our dinner experience starting the way it did. Mr. B's is a more upscale and nice restaurant and I didn't feel the southern hospitality at all! I had better service the night before at ACME! 

Our server Kevin & Renata then greeted us but being so heated I asked for the manager. EJ (Manager) came and I informed him of what happened. He offered to buy us our first round of drinks (which was very nice, but was not necessary). 

Kevin & Renata were amazing! They turned our dinner completely around the recommended amazing dishes and treated us with respect. They both are great assets to Mr. B's restaurant. I dont leave 40% tips often, but when I do it's well deserved!

Even if you aren't a shrimp fan, their filets are always cooked to perfection and their gumbo is delicious.

We ordered pretty quickly and were able to snag one of the few empty tables. While the service was incredibly slow, we found ourselves mostly distracted by music and just basking in the ambience.

Since all of our meetings have been later in the day and catered, we are given lunch, but we have had to go on our own for breakfast/dinner each day. Tuesday was our first stop in at Caf√© Beignet (311 Bourbon Street). To no surprise, this place was jam packed and we're guessing that most of these people here are tourists (after all, this is Bourbon Street and we are from out-of-town ourselves). 

All of the menu items are less than $10 and are all very tasty. I had the Cajun Hashbrowns on Tuesday and loved them so much that I returned again this morning to have them again. The ""Southern Breakfast"" (eggs, grits, bacon and bread) also looks good, but the hashbrowns had me coming back for more. They are loaded with Andouille sausage, onions and peppers and served with a side of scrambled eggs and bread. 

Had never sampled a beignet (NO-style donut with powdered sugar) and ordered one to go with my breakfast. Then another. And a third. Holy cow, these things are addictive!

The coffee is good as well. Hey, we're from Minnesota and we like good, strong coffee.

I'm fairly certain that one person should never eat three beignet at a sitting anyway, but the idea of eating three of these gives me sugar shock.  We split an order, and I still couldn't finish.

That's not really a complaint, though.  Just be aware that, if you're going for beignet, you should bring an appetite - and two friends.  Anyway, we stumbled across this little gem while we were wandering around the French Quarter, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The atmosphere is wonderful - the Cafe sits at the back of an open courtyard, with tables (some under a patio), and on Friday night, there were musicians playing jazz.  The music carried well, without being so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I believe if you went up the stairs, there was a bar up there (although, probably another establishment).  I'm tempted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere alone, but a restaurant is more than atmosphere.  It was a wonderful way to spend a Friday evening.

Other than the beignet, the food was fine.  It was nothing spectacular, but I got a pretty good club, and my fiance got a pretty good roast beef po'boy.  My bread was a little stale - it happens.  It seemed like we had to wait an awfully long time for the beignet to come out.  I know they're fried fresh, but I've also made them before, and I know it doesn't take 15 minutes.

Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol

Cafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!

Cafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  
----
Conclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!

Essentially asked us to leave and gave no reason.

Friendly staff. Large menu. My hubby ordered the Ribeye and fries. They seasoned and cooked it perfectly. I ordered the chicken carbonara. Unfortunately it's without the egg but was very good anyway.

Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai!

The service was very courteous and that is the only reason why I'd give it 2 stars instead of 1. They can prepare dish, according to their menu, at different spice levels. So, I selected one of the dishes that looked interesting (The King and I) and I ordered it to be prepared at medium spice without the pineapples that apparently came with it.

The dish came stocked with pineapples tasting like shrimps in sugar syrup ! I was in a hurry and didn't want to make a fuss of it, but regardless, when the host came by to ask how the dish was, I mentioned that it was too sugary. He explained that somehow his internet system had gone down when he was sending the instructions to the kitchen. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but with only 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant at the time, perhaps a little more attention to what is happening in the kitchen and how the food is being served would do well.

I'd accept their apology, but to be a great restaurant, you need to look at various aspects of the experience and simply being courteous to guests is only but 2/5ths of task at hand.",2015-11-18 22:54:59,Jasmine Rice - Rittenhouse,306 S 16th St,Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9470839462,-75.1682054067,3.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip.

The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires.

My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.

Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind.

The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. 

We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood.

quickly:
Crab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don't taste like ""crab"" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).

clam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too ""fishy"" which can happen with clam chowder.

We saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!

some notes: 
-The indoor seating is limited. It's a small ""shack"" at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.

The buns looked yummy but I passed on them and ate the chicken and slaw from the sandwich with what I guess was their white bbq sauce (looked light orange). The chicken was on the rare side and the slaw was meh. I ordred the grit casserole and green beans for my sides. The green beans were fresh and the grits were yummy. My friends ordered the special of the day - rib sandwich and they raved about it along with the baked beans and chilled bean salad. The atmosphere is good and I loved the deck for outdoor dining. They had a great selection of sides and I'd be happy just eating them next time.

288,369,Y-nRM21X885k9gbt-oNajA,oQ5CPRt0R3AzFvcjNOqB1w,1,"First, pork was super dry last night. Surprising since it was a busy, holiday weekend so you'd think they be turning out lots of fresh pork instead of a product that tasted like it had been sitting under a dry heat lamp for hours. However, wings were pretty darn tasty. A touch under done but worth coming back for. Ribs and pork are dead to me though.

The biggest disappointment about our recent visit was the way the ""wait in line, order, get your number and sit down"" process soooo doesn't work at this place. To be fair, it's not Mr. Edley's fault that the douchebag hipsters and self absorbed yuppie parents don't have enough common sense or courtesy to not sit down before they've ordered and obtained a number but seriously, PUT UP SOME SIGNS or have the bus people and manager politely ask people who have rudely tied up a table (or 3) while their party waits to get up. When I suggested to the cashier that they might have an issue this past Saturday, she said they ""don't allow that"" but then nobody told the family of 8 who committed this major foul to get up while we looked around for a place to sit (after ordering, of course). 

My thoughts for Edley's 1) your food quality is slipping 2) your customers apparently need to be taught that sitting down before ordering throws the whole balance of your system off--find a way to tell them.

P.S. If you're a party of 10 and looking to sit together on their patio on a busy night, go somewhere else unless you're prepared to respect the system and try your luck for a table...AFTER YOU'VE ORDERED!",2014-05-26 01:19:47,Edley's Bar-B-Que - 12 South,2706 12th Ave S,Nashville,TN,37204,36.1229732,-86.7897823,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1
289,370,wtmcUcibLjqk36XJQMoNRA,oQ5CPRt0R3AzFvcjNOqB1w,1,"Well, I hope I don't offend the BBQ police with this review....but I didn't order ANY BBQ here....what I did order was, possibly, the best hot chicken sandwich I have ever had....no small feat in a town that DOMINATES the world of hot chicken.

I was convinced to try out Edley's when a friend in town billed it as 'unique and gourmet BBQ'....OK, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but what the hell, I'll give it a whirl!  I like good BBQ, but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken, and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So, I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?), I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn, I AM a brave man.

We sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it, I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken, but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy, I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side, but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.  

Anyway, I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food, full bar, nice set up inside, and a great patio as well.

The fried pickles were decent and the tacos were excellent! Good flavor and great texture. I'll definitely be having those again! Don't bother deciding on your sides until you get up to the counter and can see the board because they do not have everything on the menu every day. The mac and cheese was so good! It wasn't what I expected from a BBQ place! The ""baked beans"" we're also good but they are really mixed beans and not at all like the BBQ baked beans you get at other places. Still good, just not baked. 
They also had Abita Strawberry and the Blackforest Kolsch. Excellent bar selection!!
I'm docking them a star because of the system of ordering at the counter and then taking the plastic number to a table. This system works in theory, and in practice at other places, but you HAVE to keep people from ""saving tables"" when they have yet to order. I get it if you have a group of 10 but for normal sized tables, it throws the whole system off! The line was long last night but the food comes out fast so tables turn over quickly. By the time we ordered there were no open tables. There were around 8 tables taken up by people who were still 20 minutes from ordering. That throws the whole system off! Let people who have already ordered eat. Another table will open up for you by the time you order!
This can easily be solved by posting a sign and asking the servers to enforce it. 
Luckily there were two spots open at the bar.

Truly.

First bit of fabulousness:  Upon being seated, I ordered coffee.  To which, my server responded, ""Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?""

Are you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.

Fortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  

The Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.

One final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.

Plus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.  Not merely the slight modification of items on their regular menu--but an entire menu of creative gluten free options.

Get to it!",2014-10-11 18:39:04,Le Peep,3036 N Eagle Rd,Meridian,ID,83646,43.6327829,-116.3523931,4.0,1,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience.

Very friendly staff / Our waitress was wonderful
Food was delicious. I had the caesar salad, short ribs & chocolate financier for dessert.  The short ribs literally melted in my mouth!
My husband & I split the shrimp cocktail which included only 3 but they were very large. These were good , wasn't crazy about the cocktail sauce.
He ordered the house salad with balsamic - equal to or even tastier than the tangy Caesar. For an entree he enjoyed the flounder paella style- which not only included rice but also clams, mussels & calamari. He devoured it in minutes :)
I forget the name is his dessert but there was mellon & a type of sherbet or pudding in the center. 
The meal is served with a seasoned bread & creamy butter. 
They also have a very nice lounge area surrounding the bar for an after or before dinner cocktail. There were people eating some apps there as well. 

Restaurant week menus tend to leave a person hungry & wanting more. Not here. I was actually unable to finish my entree even with help from my husband. Very good sign of their every day standards:)

My husband and I went the Friday before V-Day (that's Valentine's Day, gutter-brains), and we really didn't know what to expect aside from guaranteed truffle oil (we know our Daniel Stern).

After a slightly awkward ascent via the elevator with a couple who looked like they might be going up to the 37th floor to push each other out the window, we arrived at a fairly fab, glam-but-not-overdone space that was obviously fancy but not so fancy that I wished I'd broken out the fur.

We waited at the bar and had a couple ""eh"" house speciality cocktails (something manhattan-ish... something else wtih gin...not memorable, obvi), followed by a couple glasses of wine.  I remember the eye candy who served my drinks more than what I had.  Gorgeous girls behind the bar and in the cocktail area.  When we were ushered to our table, we finally checked out the menu and saw at least 40 things we wanted to try, so we thought it over while snacking on olive loaf and sourdough bread - both amazing.

For starters, we ordered the warm spinach salad (I think it was served with pate?) with poached egg.  It was to die for -- perfect amount of egginess, great presentation all around.  I ordered the lobster roll (lobster roll with a hint of lavender!!) on house-made brioche, which came with chips and some other cute little lobster-tentacle-esque garnish.  I seriously housed this lobster roll, and hoarded it so that my husband couldn't have any.  Happy Valentine's day, baby.  F-ign unreal.

Main course... My husband ordered the salmon, which was poached in olive oil and probably the single best piece of salmon I've ever eaten.  I was SO JELLY over his order.  I had the flatbread with arugula and truffle oil (see earlier reference in part one of this food novella), and a side of broccoli, which somehow was the best broccoli I've ever eaten.  Someone obviously crushed pretty hard on the broc while they were making it, because it was unreal and just so delicate... Yes, I just reviewed a side of broccoli. For realsies.

Dessert (yeah, we went there) was beignets, and this crazed garbanzo bean cookie topped with poached pears and honey ice cream.  Our server brought out some delicious honey-related (I say related because I don't know if it was infused or how it got there) cognac to pair it with.  I had one of those ""food moments"" where I was like... You know what?  I'm okay with everything in life right now and I would like to have the Chef's love child in the very near future.

Unbelievable meal, amazing service, sweet atmosphere, and a meal I can recall in complete detail a month later.  Bravo, R2L.",2010-03-13 17:40:15,R2L,"50 S 16th St, Fl 37",Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9516172612,-75.167190457,3.5,0,2,,,1,0,0,1,0,1
354,439,hvyDrBHpzky5ulYcoAW0Fg,9gObo5ltOMo6UgsaXaHPWA,3,"We had a great dinner at R2L during Restaurant Week.  Everything was great, but I'm only giving it 4 stars primarily because of the price.  We'd love to go back, but the food is so pricey, we'll probably wait until a (very) special occasion.  

I had been to R2L for drinks during Center City Sips and wanted to try it for dinner as the menu looked very good and I couldn't get enough of the view.  The only reservation I could get was for 5:30pm on a Wednesday night of Restaurant Week (I really appreciate that they're on Open Table).  While we weren't there for sunset, the timing was fine as it turned out to be a cloudy day.  We had a table with a great view to the west.  

The server was so welcoming and accommodating.  Everything we ate was fantastic.  My risotto was awesome and a huuuuge portion, but my husband's entree wasn't as big.  Still hungry, he tried three times to get more of the bread (which was delicious, by the way), asking everyone that passed by our table from our server to beyond, but we never got a second helping which was a little annoying.

One item of note was the noise at the bar.  We were seated immediately adjacent to the bar area, and it was quite loud.  Both Wednesdays we were there, for Center City Sips a few weeks ago and for Restaurant Week recently, the bar was incredibly packed and loud.  R2L seems to be a swanky, popular place to get a drink after work, but maybe the crowd disperses a little bit later in the evening..  

The food really was incredibly good, and I do look forward to going again, hopefully getting a window seat, away from the bar area, on a very special occasion or for the next restaurant week!",2011-09-27 21:11:52,R2L,"50 S 16th St, Fl 37",Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9516172612,-75.167190457,3.5,0,2,,,1,0,0,1,0,1

They add a mix to their food so it isnt just the standard. For apps we enjoyed the lobster, crab cakes, mini burgers, bacon wrapped scallops dumplings, and the flat bread. All were delicious. The bread basket was even good! I was full just from that alone and completely satisfied. But then for the main course I got the lobster paella. Not at all what I was expecting. I lived in spain and was thinking traditional paella. This was more of a seafood medley - no rice. It was delicious as well but just an fyi. Most people at my table got the steak and ribs which was also very good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. 

We had to go for dessert and ended up getting a vanilla cake with ice cream. So yummy. R2L also brough us 2 complimentary pallet cleansers which were interesting. Nice of them, but nothing to write about.

Drinks were good - liked their wine choice. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. He definitely pushed only expensive items when asked for recommendations of wine and entrees though which annoyed me.

We came for dinner but walked through the bar to our table. Happy Hour was packed and looked fun. It is a little too dark for my taste but it is a nice place and the deals were awesome. Stella was $3 as were other beers and they had a selection of wines for $5.

And lastly - the ambiance. I liked how it was decorated but it would have been lighter. The way the tables were set gave enough space to not be on top of people and to feel private.

356,441,Yejlr4J825ONHfko9AF89Q,9gObo5ltOMo6UgsaXaHPWA,4,"My expectations were fairly high for this place and ultimately I left somewhat disappointed (and $200 less in my wallet). What you are really paying for is the view here. While we didn't lay down a $200 deposit to guarantee a window seat, we did get one. I think this was because we ate so early on a Sat evening (5:30pm reservations). We were seated on the West side and the sun was setting. Fortunately I had my sunglasses with me although they did offer to pull down the shades for me as well. The views were definitely lovely but it likely would have been better had we gone later in the evening when the lights of the city were coming alive. 

Service was excellent throughout the entire meal. Our waitress took good care of my wife who is gluten free. We asked her what a few of the roads/bridges were that we were looking at, but she sort of guessed at it. You would thinking working there they would be required to know the more major landmarks out there. Oh well.

As for the food, that's what left me disappointed. I started with the Steakhouse Salad. I guess I just assumed there would be some meat in it, but sadly, there was none to be found. There were quite a few olives in there and unfortunately I'm not an olive fan, so ultimately I wasn't able to finish the salad. My wife's roasted shrimp though wasn't bad. For our entrees, she went with the Salmon while I had the Filet and Shortrib Duo. In the end, it was pretty good but it certainly didn't wow me or anything. I've had better meals and other restaurants in the city. At least the evening ended on a more positive note with dessert. My Lemon Tart was delicious and you can tell they have a pastry chef on site. Not many gluten free options for my wife, so she just had sorbet.",2016-06-24 10:35:47,R2L,"50 S 16th St, Fl 37",Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9516172612,-75.167190457,3.5,0,2,,,1,0,0,1,0,1

- We were staying a nearby hotel.
- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.
- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.
- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!
- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.
- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...
- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. 
- Clean the bathroom!!

We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice.

We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. 

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave.

I have to say, had the burger and pork belly buns and they were excellent. Also had the BBQ crisp appetizer that had a great flavor yet it needed something to soak up the sauce. Finally had the lamb braised noodles and they were great. Again I wanted to soak up every ounce of the sauce. They should go against the norm and serve a nice crusty bread- blasphemy you might say but seriously something must be done to soak up these flavors.

Now onto the bad part, the prices.  Way too expensive for everything.

There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. 

However, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. 

Besides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. 

The slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.

Back to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off.

Pros.

The ramen is great! The wings everyone is talking about are so delicious. I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. 

It's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  

The drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. 

Cons.

It's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.

This is more of an unpopular request but maybe a sake lemonade or sangria for us sweet cocktail lovers or a sweet cider on the beer menu.

Came here with my boyfriend when we were in Philadelphia for a business trip. The place is small and cozy. When we got there, it was 9pm and had been walking around in 20degree weather, so we were down for something warm. Here is where half a star leaves the rating. The hostess did not look like she wanted anyone coming in. She had a little attitude when she told us to stand by the ramen wall. When seats were available, the hostess took her sweet time cleaning up despite people waiting to be seated.  I understand the place is a little cramped but it does not take 10mins to clean a table, especially if the table is literally 3x3. The waiter and waitress were wonderful and after we had ordered I was watching the chef cook.  The other half star for the following: The entire time the chef was cooking, she would pull her phone out and text. That's disgusting! She wasn't wearing gloves also. The chef is picking up up ingredients with her hands that she just used to text and puts them into the bowls they're serving! Now onto the food. My bf and both got the miso ramen with the spicy bean paste as an add on. The broth was good but after adding the spicy bean paste and mixing in the egg, it got creamy and even better.

The noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.

We also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp ""En Cocotte"" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape√±o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.",2013-05-29 14:29:00,Luke,333 Saint Charles Ave,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9507416316,-90.0704155423,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-M√®re as my entr√©e. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with.

All the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.

Other than the amazing briny ice cold oysters, my wife and I also had a selection of various apps and cocktails all of which were in the good to excellent range. The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle.

Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? 
Now onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my ""first time""!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can't just get these flavors anywhere you know. 
And if all of the above wasn't enough like too idiots we walked to Caf√© du Mond for coffee and beignets. 
We took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.  Try the Scallabutt (scallops fused with a hunk of Halibut).  Se bon!! and Happy eating!",2013-07-13 02:54:04,Luke,333 Saint Charles Ave,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9507416316,-90.0704155423,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

Our first try at Luke was for dinner on my birthday... My Etouffee was great, my date's steak was over cooked and possibly expedited wrong, as it took mere seconds for them to return with a medium rare steak. Unfortunately it came back out over salted but he opted not to send it back again (I don't blame him). 

I really wanted the bread pudding with pecan sauce just didn't have room, so ordered it via room service the next night and again was under whelmed again, it arrived only slightly warm with the ice cream completely melted (they were in separate containers). 

On our last day in town (Friday) we wanted to give it one more shot since it wasn't Mardi Gras and life seemed to be returning to normal... court-bouillon was okay, however the chicken on my salade de poulet grille, was almost raw, that's right, barely cooked chicken on my plate!

Gabe and I went here at his suggestion for his ""better late than never"" birthday dinner. One of the few times I'm allowed to pick up the tab ;)
He opted for beer and I opted for wine. Both enjoyable. He got the special which was some kind of sweet and spicy fried chicken. I got the shrimp and grits. The portions were small for those used to large meals but for us, it was perfect. Left room for more beer later. 
Atmosphere was dark and cozy. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. Made reservations, arrived early and seated immediately. 
So about those chairs.... They're super cute but as I leaned over to grabbed my card that leaped off the table, I went down sloooowly. It was funny actually. A manager ran up to see if I was ok. Between my giggles, I told her ""yes"". Glad it wasn't a first date lol.

We got the $65 oyster platter which came with 12 huge and succulent oysters, about a dozen each of clams and mussels, 10-12 tails of jumbo shrimp, about half of a huge king crab, 2 small sauce cups of ceviche, and 3 different sauces including a malt vinegar, cocktail sauce, and a spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce, as well as multiple wedges of lemon.  The platter was huge and probably could have fed 3-4 people, though I was able to eat most of it with some help from the fiancee.  The oysters were fresh and delicious and were the star of the platter, while the crab was the not seasoned and somewhat bland compared to the rest of the platter.  Of note, I liked the shrimp as they were steamed with a spicy cajun seasoning which was a nice Louisiana touch.

We also ordered the fried oyster, bacon, romaine lettuce, and avocado salad which was decent.  The fried oysters on the salad were perfectly prepared, though the bacon was thick cut and a bit on the tough/chewy side (i prefer bacon in a salad to be crispy).

THE BAD: Service was horrible.  I think we got the worst server in the restaurant; here's the breakdown: His appearance--his long hair made me think he should have been in an 80's hair metal band instead of serving in a moderately upscale seafood restaurant.  His service--inattentive: 1. he never introduced himself before taking our order, 2. he didn't allow us to finish our order as after we ordered our oyster platter he took our menus and walked away and I had to get another waiter/server to order a salad that we wanted to come with our oyster platter, 3.  He forgot our bread, and we didn't realize we were supposed to get bread until halfway through our meal when we saw other tables getting bread, 4. We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal.  The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said ""here you go"" and continued walking away like he didn't care.  Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions.  I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal.  Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food.  If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.",2014-02-24 03:58:18,Luke,333 Saint Charles Ave,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9507416316,-90.0704155423,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

One of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end, dessert. 

For our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison, served with fresh herbs, touch of horseradish and country bread croutons. 

My choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalape√±o Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland, this one knocked my socks off. 

The wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour, then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes, green beans and roasted vegetables. 

Please, try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.

Our server was attentive, fast, and funny (albeit non-intentionally). The martinis were fantastic and the oysters were fresh, fresh, fresh! But...take it to the bridge!

Pros:

Service - wonderful
Bar options - excellent
No waiting!
Oysters on the 1/2 shell? Tasty, tasty, with no BP aftertaste.

Cons:

The shucker removed perhaps 4 out of 12 of the oysters from their shell. Not the seamless experience I wanted, and it stopped me from ordering an additional dozen. I was also surprised there wasn't a different type of dipping sauce, like a mignonette offered. I'm happy to make my own cocktail sauce, but I was surprised...
The gumbo? For me, it was odd - all roux, with not much seafood, chicken or sausage. And, rice seemed like a practice batch of risotto was used - it was gummy and crunchy.

I'm ready to go back and get more oysters, but maybe with a different shucker working....",2010-11-22 17:33:40,Luke,333 Saint Charles Ave,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9507416316,-90.0704155423,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

I honestly don't understand how this restaurant got such high reviews. Either people had low expectations or they entered here drunk from an adventure at bourbon st or Frenchmen.

I ordered a river bend and it was made absolutely horrible. It tasted like medicine or as if the vodka was randomly thrown in grape juice and ass. 

I ordered a charcuterie board, little neck clams, oysters, Brussel sprouts, and the shrimp grits. The charcuterie board and Brussel sprouts were amAzing. The Brussel sprouts had a seared and sweet vinaigrette flavor. Even though I really prefer the charcuterie sampler at cochon butcher over the charcuterie here it was still good. It came with a rabbit pate which was wonderful.

As we waited for our clams to come out, the server came to notify us that they were out of clams (thirty minutes later btw). So we ordered a half dozen oysters instead. Those came out within five minutes. However instead of getting a half dozen oysters, we ended up receiving only five oysters on our plate. WTF?!?! We notified our server and he ended up bringing us two additional oysters which was nice, but seriously?! How does a restaurant like this hire people that don't know the basics of counting? That right there made me question the quality of the restaurant and how overhyped this was due to john besh. The oysters were shucked wonderfully but that's really all I can give them credit for.

Anyways, we finished all of our appetizers and waited an incredibly long time for the shrimp and grits. After waiting too long, we canceled our order with another waitress and our server finally came out to tell us that our order was ready but he wanted to wait for us to finish our appetizers to bring out the plate. I don't know of any restaurant that would make you wait an hour for your entree but sure... When the shrimp and grits came out I was honestly disappointed. 

I'm sorry to say but this restaurant may be nice but it absolutely does not deserve to be a four star restaurant. If you want good prices, good taste, and service I would go to royal house instead. Otherwise Ya no..... I would never go back here again nor recommend this place to someone else... I am so sad that this place was such a disappointment. Thanks John besh.

After confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him ""no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?"" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small.

The cool factor is that I have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from Vince Gill or Kevin Costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare. 

Now the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu. I usually get a half order because I have a small appetite. My favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world. I also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top.

They were fluffy and doughy, much like the ones at McDonald's or any number of short order diners in the country.

For a Tuesday morning, we waited about 20-30 minutes (No line at 12 pm). There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. 

For that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Not worth waiting at all.

The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. 


******************UPDATE***********************

So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him ""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.""

We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. 

To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. 

They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.

Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for ""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist"" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.",2017-03-15 01:54:12,La Casita,634 Julia St,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9458122,-90.0712732,4.0,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

We arrived about 7 pm‚Äã on a Friday night and the place was nearly full with just a few tables left. We were seated immediately at a table for four. The tables are a bit close, with the angle of our table I was practically sitting in the next table, we actually joked with them about it.

Our server was pretty amazing, she got drinks, kept them refilled and took our first course orders, she kept checking back and never made us feel rushed.

My husband and I started off sharing‚Äã a number of appetizers -we started with crab rangoon, gyoza, shrimp shumai and spring rolls. The food came up pretty quickly considering how full the restaurant was. 

The spring‚Äã rolls were light and crisp, the crab rangoon pretty standard, the shrimp shumai was‚Äã moist‚Äã but the flavor was really blah. The gyoza was HORRIBLE, they were hard, dry and not any better than we'd buy in any supermarket‚Äã.

The biggest challenge I have is with the food runners, they have several young guys who seem to speak very little English‚Äã. They kind of grunt when they come to the table and food is shoved in front of you, whether there is any room or not. 

The portions are relatively small, I completely understand that they will bring you as much as you need. But, the plates they use are HUGE for three small pieces of shumai and the guys running food spill all of‚Äã the sauces out of the wells in the dishes.

For my second round,‚Äã I had the Hot and Sour Soup - it was very good, not to think‚Äã or heavy, nicely‚Äã spiced with lots of tofu and vegetables.

The Seaweed Salad was chilled, a few kinds of seaweed, nice flavor.

The Chicken Tempura was more‚Äã tonkatsu, breaded and fried crisp‚Äã, moist and crunchy but not a tempura batter.

I finished up with a Philadelphia and a Spicy Tuna maki roll as well as some sashimi - tuna, salmon‚Äã, ‚Äã and escolar‚Äã. All three were well chilled, thinly sliced and very fresh. The salmon was super buttery.

The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch.

The salad was fresh and served on frozen plates along with their fresh garlic bread. The crab legs came out fresh and hot and were served with mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. My only complaint is that after the initial order, they only bring out one crab claw at a time when you order more. This was a little disappointing since we were ordering all you can eat and definitely came to eat more than one at a time. The server was accommodating though and let us know that she would put in a new order each time she delivered our new plate so we never had to wait, which was nice.

Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.  

Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn't stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign.

I'm very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit. 

I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm. 

That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.

We ate some of the finest pastries I've ever had in my life at this bakery. Word.

We were fortunate enough to be with the other Gruntled Brunchers, who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery, so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries. 

Just some of what we tried: opera cake - a moist, multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu; apple strudels; fruit tarts;  eclairs; chocolate covered strawberries. All were delicious, but, then, the cheese puff pastry came out. 

The cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own. Impossibly, insanely flaky, just sweet enough, almost salty. How can this be? I could have eaten five of these. Make certain you don't miss this.

We were fortunate to be there on Good Friday, so we could get a hot cross bun. I thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising. I was so, so wrong. This traditional treat is a brioche-type bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout, and an icing ""X"" drawn on the top. Again, light, airy, with sweetness that is a hint, not a sledgehammer. There's a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun, and Patricia, the executive chef, took the time to tell us. Check it out on Wikipedia if you're curious.

And, I have to say something about the raspberry ""bear claw"". If you've ever had what others call a bear claw, forget those. Brent said it's an insult to this crazy-good, flaky, just-right pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine. 

We took a field trip, as Harry said, through the kitchen, where Ziggy, the owner, pastry chef, and all-around nice guy, was making a Harry Potter wizard hat cake. He rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake. He gave us a taste of the fondant. In my experience, fondant is pretty but not so tasty. Not so for this chocolate fondant. Mmmmmmm! I would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff. 

We left with a tea cake in tow. Ziggy told us it was something like a Kugelhof, and not as heavy as a pound cake. It was so beautiful, I simply had to try one, though at this point I really didn't need more pastries. I had a piece as soon as I could get a knife. Again, unbelievable...I can't say more. Somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light, and just moist enough without approaching stickiness. I had more of this than I care to admit right after I'd eaten my weight in sweets.

At this point, I'm glad I do not live down the street from Maple Street Patisserie. I could see myself having a problem if I lived too close to a bakery this tempting.

Just to sum it all up: the sweet pastries are delectable, but the breads, brioches, bear claws!, and tea cakes are in a class all their own.

And, I haven't even tried the savory croissants yet.",2011-04-23 00:00:54,Maple Street Patisserie,7638 Maple St,New Orleans,LA,70118,29.9416242,-90.1295134,3.5,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The poboy list was astounding, and great contemporary takes on such things as 'Oysters Rockefeller'.

The chicken andouille sausage gumbo was fair. I've had better at various other establishments. A lack of rice, a lack of ""trinity"" (seasoning) and sparse nuggets of andouille and chicken were certainly a disappointment. The roux was the perfect darkness, but it lacked body and substance. I wouldn't have it again, and I don't recommend anyone try it, especially if you have had a good gumbo. It will fail to please.

The red beans and sausage were awesome. Creamy, with a great mouth-feel, superbly seasoned, the red beans may be the best I've had -- and I've been frequenting New Orleans restaurants for over three decades. The sausage was a great example of a good smoked sausage with a hint of piquant, crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. Now, the rice... why is it something so simple could ruin an otherwise perfect meal? First, red beans (unless you're serving soup) is traditionally served with rice. Rice should be fluffy, warm, and moist. This was obviously left in a steam pan with no lid. It was dry, hard, brittle, and inedible. Why even serve the stuff? Rice is cheap, make another batch, don't serve something you wouldn't stand behind!

The service was absolutely terrible. I had to wait to get a drink order (7 minutes, I timed it). I had to wait to get my drink (8 minutes, timed again). My food order was taken by another waiter who saw I had not been served, and by the look on his face, felt sorry for me. My waiter did not check on my food service until after I had finished my meal -- fortunately, the owner did check on me. I even had to wait to pay my bill -- which to me, if someone is looking to pay and leave, and you're in the business to generate revenue -- it's important to make sure they have the bill and make a timely payment.

After all the negative reviews, why would I give Katie's such a high rating? Well, I will tell you. A) The Food. B) the atmosphere C) I'm not going to let a worthless server ruin a good establishment D) the owner took an interest in my experience.

Try Katie's for yourself. If you have as bad of a serving experience as I had, inform the owner. I did not, and I regret it.",2015-04-01 21:20:04,Katie's Restaurant & Bar,3701 Iberville St,New Orleans,LA,70119,29.9730943,-90.0959144,4.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

One of the people in my party didn't even receive their food until we were sitting at the hostess stand waiting TO LEAVE!! Granted the waitress continually reminded us that it was only her 3rd shift, but every mistake was inexcusable.  We walked into the restaurant at 8:30 pm, during the time we were there our order was messed up several times, random food was brought to us many times and we were constantly asked if we had ordered it or not. We had to remind our waitress several times what our order was, additionally when we stopped her to remind her that we had been waiting 30+ minutes for certain items she argued with us by saying that she had already brought it.  If she had actually brought it then it would have probably been in the pile of dishes that littered our table, which another waitress came by to clear AT THE END OF THE MEAL.  Of course, the one dish missing from the dirty junk on our table was the plate that should have been the trash for the shells of TWO orders of edamame we had.  Even though we waited one hour and a half for ONE sushi roll all we got was a simple ""sorry.""

Done deal. We get there, and she was right about the area. The food was quite underwhelming. Nothing tasted very fresh. In fact, everything I got from the sushi buffet was soggy and maybe even slightly warm (not good for uncooked food).

It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold, gelatinous, and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap, fast food-ish, ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef, Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said, once upon a time), but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.

With each bite, I kept hoping the next would be better. But, alas. It wasn't.

THE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON""T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. 

THE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you. A few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise (literrally) for your birthday. 5 years ago they even gave me a $25 giftcard for my birthday when I celebrated there. A couple years ago I made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group. When we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table. :(  Last couple of years it doesn't seem like they do much for birthdays.

Positives:
The menu is extremely creative and gargantuan! I love that they have some cheaper options, and plenty of variety.

Negatives:
Ru San's has the worst service I have ever had. On a typical dinner night out with my wife (even on odd weekdays), it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there. The waiters seem to either disappear, or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected. On many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server.

Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers.

When I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.

When I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I've grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.

As for the bartenders, it's really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she's friendly, attentive, funny, and I've really gotten to know her, and I'd give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she's there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we're doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I've had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I've had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I'd give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.

little heavenly bits of crunchy potatoes. I had the tri/tip/chicken combo, selecting the fresh corn salad and potato salad as my two sides.

My son ordered the chicken strips and we all got French fries as our side. Jesse, our server was nice enough but in the loud dining room you couldn't hear a word he said.

Spring roll was soggy inside, lacked flavor and the included sauce didn't help.
Lemongrass soup was good - albeit only contains mushroom.
Thai iced tea was too sweet.
Red curry chicken was sweet rather than hot. Something didn't taste right with that (it's curry).
Pad Thai was soggy and didn't taste like regular Pad Thai.
Lastly the mango with black sticky rice. Sticky rice was too sweet - they had incorporated the condensed milk into it so there's no way to adjust the sweetness.

We had one of the worst meals & I spent almost $180.00.
We sat outside, which was charming, except  we felt  lucky when the waiter showed up at our table. He was rushed & apologized for the lack of wine choices.
The bread was wonderful...
The Osso buco was hard, dry & so salty it was inedible.
Sent that back, the waiter was nice about it, brought back the Scallop dish which was still oversalted &  really bad. 
The side of grilled, Burnt, slimy asparagus was also salty & over cooked. And I truly wanted to send it back because it was horrible....did I mention cold?
But we were starting to get in a hurry to leave so we could wash out the bad taste in our mouth.

My chicken dish was better than a microwave one from Big Lots, but the chicken was chewy, rubbery, 4 sure Not Organic, Farm Raised... Must be steroid chicken , no taste, and I cannot remember the name of the dish, I believe it had a few morsels of pasta with it.  Ughh...

The 1 star is for our waiter , he was OK, but I am SO OVER egoist, affected, waiters telling me about their view on wine, when they obviously have NO clue.
I mention a Gaja Barberesco & he suggests the Amarone. And he continued with a Soliloquy on all the names of Top Italian Wines he knew & 10 minutes go by &  Guess what, they did not offer 1 of the them on their wine list!  So he wastes time trying to show me He Knows wine's names, but Timpanodoes not carry them.

 My associate polished most of the Wine choice off her self. Which was good and was priced ok, I think the bottle was around $40.00. 
Their wine list is minimal.
 We expected an Italian Restaurant but it was more a New York Steak House.The food was ordinary, over salty, waaay over priced. And don't get me started on the Duo they booked 4 entertainment...

The ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be.

I received some feedback from the ownership and I must say I'm impressed with their outreach to their customer base.

The first time I ever went there like 5 years ago, I got the El Fino Wrap (it's this wrap with poached pears, gorgonzola cheese, toasted (i think) pecans and maybe some dried cranberries and onion?), and I almost passed away it was so amazing. To this day it's still my favorite thing there, and in my top 5 favorite foods on earth.  They don't have it on the dinner menu though, but you can always order it.  THAT is my ultimate fav.
In terms of soup - they are like soupmakers from the future.  Flavor combos I've never heard of warm ginormous bowls. The thai carrot soup makes me want to live in Thailand and become a carrot farmer.  They drizzle this creme fraiche on top and.... yeah.  You get it.  I also had this really awesome beet soup there... Which reminds me...
Those crazy cooks at Blue Sage are like Masters of the Beet.  In fact, I was not aware of the degree at which I adore the beet until I'd seen it cooked/utilized about 5 different ways there. It's awesome.
Then it's like, okay.... What else could they do to be Awesome McAwesometon?  Oh, they could have world-class desserts (w vegan options too) that make you want to setup a little cot and just live in their dining room.
So, obviously, I love this place.
One more thing - I prefer Blue Sage for lunch.  The options are there, it's cheaper, and they actually have more stuff I like on the lunch menu.

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.

768,940,TI7f_5wqqH0W5sNpMjFPYA,ORL4JE6tz3rJxVqkdKfegA,7,"This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:

1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. 

2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, ""I don't know"" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.

3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.

4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a ""quick bite"" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.

Little far from town but a good middle point between music row and the airport. Hotel staff was top notch and the place was clean while still having that old charm.

We stopped by to see the hotel, but didn't stay there as guests. This place wasn't really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you're flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) 

Parking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you're mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it's a nice walk.

The hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an ""outdoor"" feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by ""Delta River Boat Tours"" which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the ""fascinating"" facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: ""Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN!"" (So old!) or, our favorite, ""Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND"" (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!) 

Anyway, it was hilarious. Seems like a nice place just to see/have a drink/ maybe dinner if prices aren't insane.

It's beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side/back entrance of Opryland.

I reserved our room on line, and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. 

This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less. 

I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.

773,945,-EeFd11mIbuOL8iQkadNIQ,ORL4JE6tz3rJxVqkdKfegA,0,"Wow. We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. 
Dinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. 
There are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6"" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms.

778,950,KKeaXrGNFHH0bIAawb0YWA,ORL4JE6tz3rJxVqkdKfegA,2,"I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  

First off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  

The hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated ""Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings"".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told ""our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted"" I replied ""I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted"" I was then told ""well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available"" and I said ""no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed"" and was told ""OK, sorry you are disappointed"".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.

Once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said ""oh, they aren't running tonight"" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  

I'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.

It's like a Vegas Style resort(One of the reasons why Nashville is refereed to as Nashvegas?). There are tons of restaurant options, fun little bars, and maps all over the place. I didn't get lost once. With that said..... 

My advice to someone coming to Nashville for the first time is... Don't stay here. Here are my reasons why: 

-It's far from town. About 10 miles. And let's be real...that's probably why you come to Nashville?

-Unless you have a rental car, you will be in Taxi or shuttle debt. One way to downtown in Taxi is $25 or the Gaylord shuttle is $30 something for Roundtrip...but the last pickup was a little too early for my liking. 

-The city bus doesn't come very often and doesn't run late. But a way cheaper way to get into town. ($1.60) 

-The restaurants are expensive and they don't have any local appeal. When I'm traveling, I want to eat local fare. Why isn't there southern food, bbq? 

-I feel like they basically want you to stay on their property the entire time! 

-Expensive! I didn't have to pay for my room (thank god) but if I had to I couldn't afford to.

The black bean burger was dry. Sweet potato fries were good. 

Today while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant.

They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. 

No one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled.

The donuts here are imaginative and original. I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning. 

New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn't get a chance to try the one at Wink's in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It's a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I'm more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. 

District has ""croquenuts"" available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the ""Monte Cristo"" for it's sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.

Finally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. 

Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts. 

You bet I'll make another (or several) stops next time I'm in New Orleans.",2017-01-15 09:03:54,District Donuts Sliders Brew,2209 Magazine St,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9294259,-90.0770687,4.5,1,0,,,1,1,1,0,0,1

Fried chicken was delicious.  Perfectly fried, not too heavy.  Their was a nice kick on the chicken along with some jalape√±o and a nice slaw to go with it.  Fried oyster was good, too. Nicely battered (cornmeal crusted?) and fried.  Not at all greasy.  You can still taste the oyster. The pork belly was decent.  Just as you'd expect from fatty pork belly with pickled onions.

So I found this spot on Yelp. They had 8-10 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them. Praline bacon, raspberry white chocolate, pineapple upside down, and cookies and milk. Praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow! It was a flavor party where sweet, savory and yummy had me dancing. The pineapple upside donut was good. The raspberry was my least favorite. However, the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it. Overall, the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty.

832,1004,FkWOYLmtWCM_cKmlXezZ1g,8uF-bhJFgT4Tn6DTb27viA,3,"This place.... dang... they make some delicious donuts thats for sure... I stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to NOLA (only to their Mag St. location). Each time I visited the line was somewhat longer than what I had hoped. Although, the line went by very quickly. I waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day. I can't really complain there. A few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate ""donut to-go"" window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go. What a brilliant idea!

Per their name, they obviously serve items other than donuts. They have breakfast items (about 5 or 6 to choose from) till 11am. At 11am they begin serving lunch items - sliders and tacos. I am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there. I had to try one of their breakfast biscuits. I opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. Holy cow it was delicious. Really hit the spot. 

I never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but I had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious! After seeing photos of them though, I had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns. Not too much excitement there if you ask me. I'd much rather have it on a biscuit.

Anyways, back to the donuts. They offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day. They have their standard glazed, cinnamon sugar, iced donuts each day. Those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored (and sometimes filled) donuts. Check out their Instagram page to see what they are serving each day. It is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day - I just wanted to go everyday and try all of them. My wallet would be so mad at me. Being the huge bacon lover that I am, I had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu.. my last day in NOLA, it finally did. I was pumped! It was delicious, fresh, flavorful, and savory. The bacon was honestly pretty good by itself.

I tried two of their drinks as well. The Sproca-Cola and their Arnold Palmer. Sproca-cola was interesting to say the least. I was glad I tried it - but don't think I will get it again. The Arnold Palmer was also pretty decent. My ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though - too much lemonade.

The establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized. My party and I were always able to find a seat no matter how busy it was. So with all of this said, I would definitely go back if in the area again.",2017-06-06 19:04:35,District Donuts Sliders Brew,2209 Magazine St,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9294259,-90.0770687,4.5,1,0,,,1,1,1,0,0,1

There were so many scrumptious looking donuts I wanted to try but once I saw that cinnamon roll--I was sold! They warmed it up and the sugar at the top caramelized to add a bit of a crunch! Mmm. 

I also ordered a couple of sliders, Cali fries and their croque madam sandwich. Like a dummy, when I heard the name ""Sarah"" at the counter I rushed to get my sandwich--but like every other 20 year old girl who are also named Sarah I started munching into the wrong sandwich! I felt a little guilty once I realized it but boy was it delicious. The guys behind the counter called out my actual order and when I told them what happened, they couldn't have been nicer about it!

I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! 

I will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). 

As an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.

Also, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.

WHAT WE ATE
*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  

*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. 

*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. 

*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. 

*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar.

863,1057,0aC3eVgDQFE6gH2Fk-MrDg,Mha77MN_BYGB-w7DONZ5YA,3,"This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.

Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.

Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.

Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. 

Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.

Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.",2013-11-14 01:23:03,Cuenelli's Peruvian Restaurant,4801 W Hillsborough Ave,Tampa,FL,33614,27.9966052,-82.5243863,4.0,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. 
 We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. 
  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.

Typically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  

The punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.

Biggest being, the music is constant and too loud, ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do: read, work, reflect, or enjoy a good conversation. When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

There were 3 (maybe 4?) tables, florescent lighting, and we were given a roll of paper towels for napkins.  But the guy who owns it (also our server) was endearing because he was very enthusiastic about the food he and his wife make.

We only noticed Indian dishes on the menu, so we asked about the difference between Indian and Pakistani food and he told us there is no difference since they used to be the same country.  Here's what we ordered and my opinion of each:

- Keema (Lamb) Samosas.  I'd only had vegetable samosas before, so I was expecting these to contain a mix of veggies and meat,  but they were all lamb (no complaints here).

- Lamb Nihari.  This was delicious and my favorite thing we ordered.  The sauce was rich and creamy and had pieces of ginger in it.  I would absolutely order this again... Omnomnom.

- Goat Pishwari - I'd never had goat before, but it was great - I highly recommend it.  The meat was tender and the sauce was good, but not quite as great as the Nihari.  I would definitely order goat again, but I'd probably switch it up and try a different goat dish.

- Chappati.  This was a type of flatbread that I'd never had before - I don't remember it having a distinct flavor, but the texture was good and it was great for mopping up sauce.

- Garlic Naan.  This was the only disappointing thing on the menu - it was chewy and hard.  We abandoned it in favor of the chappati.  Maybe it was just a bad day... I'd give it another chance (it was only $1.50).

I'm more of a natural person. I enjoy real flavor, real fruits, and of course the perfect boba. I notice that some flavors were used by real fruits but others were just powder which I could definitely taste the different. Especially the taro flavor, being one of my favorites. 

But, if you're not too concern about natural vs powder flavor then this place could be good for you. They ask what level you would like you sweetness and any additional add-ons you would like. I always get boba but sometimes the grass jelly is pretty good too! I'd recommend you try. 

This is also a good place to catch up, talk, play board, card games and even do homework. I know it's always busy with students from the U of A and being told from them it's a nice area to just hang out, that's a pretty good sign.

I say this because I ate here last week, which was not to long ago, for a friend's birthday. There were about 7 of us, total. I called twice to change the reservation time, and they were very polite about it.

We were worried about not being able to eat here because we found out one of my friends has a peanut allergy. Knowing the way Asian restaurants work, a lot of them use peanut oil or peanut products in their food.

Three people that worked there came up to our table to listen to our orders to make sure that they got it right, and to omit any peanuts in the dishes. I believe one of them might have been the manager. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!

We ordered the roti canai (indian pancake), shrimp puff, young chow fried rice, hainanese chicken, sizzling beef, shrimp pad thai, deep fried shrimp with ginger soy sauce.

The roti is probably their most famous dish. Once you try it you'll know why. As soon as we sat down I asked if we could order an appetizer to start (since everyone was hungry and it was already 8pm). She asked if I wanted roti and how many, before I could even ask what I wanted. How'd she know? Two please!

The shrimp puff was so delicious! I'm warning you though to let it sit for a bit and give it 5 minutes. It is served HOT and WILL burn your tongue. The sauces tend to squirt out into your mouth as soon as you bite into it, which is no fun when it's extremely hot! Wait it out and you'll thank me later. The sauce was a nice touch to the shrimp puff. Very cohesive appetizer. You should definitely try this one.

Fried rice was average, as any Asian restaurant's fried rice is.

Hainanese chicken was very different ... never had anything like it. It's completely baked but served at room temperate so it gives off the feeling that it's being served ""cold"". It's actually pretty good with the soy sauce (which is served under the chicken) if you can get over the way it looks and the cold texture. We we're actually served a piece that was still blue and looked like a cyanotic chicken extremity which turned me off completely, even being in the medical field. Shivers. We decided just to set it aside and remove it so we wouldn't have to look at it anymore.

The sizzling beef was absolutely.. FORGETTABLE. Do not get this dish. It lacked flavor, and did not come out sizzling. Womp, womp.

The pad thai is also just an average dish. Nothing too special going on, probably would not get it again since I could get better pad thai elsewhere.

Now I saved the best part for last.. the deep fried fish! It normally comes with other sauces, but we requested to do a simple ginger and soy sauce. This is the best fried fish, ever! We all couldn't get our hands off it and fought for the last morsel! Main reason it was so good was because it was so crispy! Good to share due to it's size. Fairly big. I would totally go back for this.

Parking could be difficult during the weekend due to it's location, so try an odd weeknight. Like say, a thursday.",2010-11-23 20:47:24,Penang,117 N 10th St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.954044,-75.15598,3.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

Flavor was okay, nothing special, my favorite part was the really hot sauce, and the kimchi, especially flavorful! 

I feel they need to do better with pricing/value, as this seems aggressive to me, after getting an upsize at $13.99. I expect to be semi wow'd going back to my Value Equation (see profile). It was just okay, and the bowl flavors didn't really work for me, it feels like a mash, that doesn't really make sense flavor wise or texture.

All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  
We were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.

But then it was time for the main attraction of the night: our large 1/2 Bucktown and 1/2 South Side Classico. At first I thought a large would be too much food, but between my boyfriend and me, we really only ended up with three pieces of leftover (pizza for breakfast is unparalleled, am i right?). The cornmeal crust was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The toppings of each specialty pizza complemented each other well.

I was the only person in the place. I came in at that weird time between lunch and dinner rush. Regardless, the bartender was super friendly. He chatted me up about all of the local beers they have. I finally settled on a Schlafly pumpkin because it's me and it's fall. I didn't have pizza on this visit (not because it isn't amazing because it is, but because I couldn't eat a whole pizza on my own). Instead I ordered a Cesar salad and the meatball appetizer. 
First off the salad was freaking huge!!! It was tasty for a Cesar salad though they really are hard to mess up. The meatball appetizer was awesome! You get about 5 meatballs in sauce and covered with cheese alongside a few pieces of bread. The salad and meatballs were the perfect lunch.

Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.

Don't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi.

I ordered a taste of another similar dark beer to see if the problem was endemic but it wasn't. I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn't know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. 

Another thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American ""Shaker"" pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.

The shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here).

I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service.

He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.

She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.

Unfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.

Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. 

I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce souffl√©, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. 

We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.

Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!

My parents always request Oana and she is an awesome server-- answers questions, gives suggestions, and really knows the menu. We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).

Spasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it's not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.

They start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.

I started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.

First - It's a bar that happens to serve food.  This place is a little dirty but that's part of the atmosphere as noted in another review.  Not roach dirty of course.  So if you're looking for a decent sized bar and bar food then this place is for you.  If you want a decent sit-down meal however...

Our waitress was pretty cute but a little neglectful and forgot my fries and water.  Meh, it's a bar.  When I mentioned it she at least offered to get the fries.

Sue K. noted in her review ""Had some high expectations for this place with the reviews I read and the opinions I heard and I ended up highly disappointed. We ordered baby back ribs and there was a good portion but the ribs were dry as anything.""  I would agree.  I had the babybacks and they were pretty dry.  My partner wasn't thrilled with her sampler platter either so she asked to speak to someone about it.  The manager came over and explained that they cook their ribs to 'have some tug' - meaning that they aren't 'over cooked' as he said and fall off the bone.  So make sure you have some good teeth.  Personally I prefer 'fall off the bone' ribs.  I would also note that there wasn't much taste either.  I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce - which was on the side.

The owner's girlfriend (Jennifer) came over and wanted to speak with us about our experience.  For this I was really surprised and really appreciated her concern.  The owners at least don't run the place like a bar which is a good thing in my book.  She refunded the full meal and requested we come back so they could make it up to us.  I probably won't go back but I do appreciate the offer.  Looks like it would be a nice local bar though.

The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. 

Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it..

Ordered the Veggie Benedict, but asked if I could have it with egg whites. The server was puzzled and said that it already came with egg whites. Ok no big deal, it was strange that it wasn't listed that way on the menu but whatever. The server comes back a couple minutes later: ""It does come with normal eggs! All this time I thought poached eggs meant egg whites."" Uh, ok. A bit odd for a server at a restaurant that literally specializes in eggs, but still not an issue. She asks if I do indeed want the egg whites, and I say yes. A couple more minutes pass, and she comes back. ""Our kitchen doesn't know how to poach egg whites, so if you want them they'll have to scramble them."" What?? You poach an egg white just like you poach an egg. But whatever, I don't care that much so, ""Sure, that's fine.""

It took us a very long time to get our food. The restaurant was not busy. Empty tables, no wait.

Finally our food comes out, and what do you know it's cold. Not just room temp. Cold. We mention it to the server who proceeds to tell us it's because the restaurant doesn't use heat lamps because ""they have so many hands."" Apparently not enough hands to get the food out within a half hour, and to get it out warm. 

On to the food itself. I ordered what should've been a relatively healthy, easy meal. I got a plate that was literally covered in so much oil that my bennies were swimming. We're talking greasier than the greasiest Chicago pizza, but not due to fat from sausage or cheese. Oh no. There is no reason it should've been greasy at all, since all it had was spinach, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and tomatoes. It was literally just vegetable/canola oil. Even the side salad was drowning in its oily dressing. It was to the point that my own mother commented that if it had been her food, she wouldn't have touched it. We're not picky eaters; we eat anything and everything. So I proceeded to try some of my cold, oily concoction and unsurprisingly it tasted like nothing. It was so oily that none of the flavors of the vegetables could come out, and left my mouth, lips, and even fingers shining. And the hollandaise... oh god. What should've been a nice lemony-buttery sauce was a blob with the consistency of expired box pudding. Skin and all. And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before... maybe similar to cheese wiz? The stuff in a can? Yeah.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.

They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.

I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.

The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized.

The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man, what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, ""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says, ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, ""Hey, just shout and I will get you something"", or ""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! 

Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it.

I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.

Eventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more ""hip.""  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.

Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.

On their ""specials"" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.

They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  

Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.

Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.

1092,1324,tPOey7vqiGEazYB96dNccA,MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,0,"Couple of notable impressions:

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.",2014-01-17 21:10:17,Han Dynasty,3711 Market St,Philadelphia,PA,19104,39.9567105161,-75.1971027811,4.0,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

Interesting that there were three noodle shops with 2 or 3 city blocks.  I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors.

We ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. 

The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. 

The gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.

Finally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",2014-11-12 21:45:25,Kalamatas - Green Hills,3764 Hillsboro Pike,Nashville,TN,37215,36.108847,-86.8114334,3.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

The environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar & restaurant. We tried two appetizers: Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Fish Spread. Both were well prepared and delicious. For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra ""real"" napkin with the utensils. One thing for sure we will be back but at this price point, a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew.

The place is done up in a nice bbq decor, very fitting for the food they serve there. Clean, with a nice noise level, the place was packed but not loud at all. 

My cashier/food analyst, Crystal was flat out AMAZING. Crystal was enthusiastic, charming, and very knowledgeable about their menu. Every restaurant needs a Crystal. City Barbecue, if you read this, Crystal made my 1st experience at your restaurant a memorable one.

I ordered the More Cowbell per Crystal's recommendation, and I am so glad I did! this sandwich served on Texas toast was melt in your mouth good. Borderline sinful if you ask me. the brisket was spot on with flavor and tenderness. It was a little smaller than I expected for the price, but it was a lunch portion, so it makes sense. I am also glad it was not XL in size, it gave me an excuse to try their LoLo Pork. Served with vinegar slaw on the sandwich, it made me want to kiss the Pitmaster. Yes, that good. 

The vinegar slaw and baked beans sides complimented my sandwiches well, and they were a good portion too. 

The fresh brewed tea was so good too.

Among the best baked beans I've ever had. My husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his Mac and cheese looked a little bland.

We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. ""It was totally worth it,"" he later told me, ""Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.""

All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert.

I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.

It isn't like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I've been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn't take 3 hours.  

Now that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  

At lunch, I normally get the ""Goodness"" which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don't bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)

I've gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  

My husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.

The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.

As if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was!

I got a few items to share such as a Burbon Pecan cookie, chocolate chip cookie, vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing, and a vanilla cupcake with raspberry icing. 

I had a taste of the Burbon Pecan Cookie. It was not too sweet and you get nice bites of pecan; a nice hot coffee is a perfect compliment.The cupcakes were good (cake wise) but, not a huge fan of the icings. The cake itself was sweet and moist. 

Didn't get to try the Chocolate chip cookie but the concensus was that it's delicious.

Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! 

We couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)

To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fianc√©e's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.

The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way!

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.

The food: 3/5
Due to the size of the menu, your selections are very limited. I wasn't a fan of any of the apps except for the korean pancake. The kimchi and side dishes I thought were pretty fair. The soft tofu there I thought was pretty good especially for $10. But on top of that the level of spiciness you can request is awesome! The protein in the soft tofu I think are lacking and it's very subtle. You'd forget what you had ordered because their would be only one or two pieces.

My best friend and I are total foodies and truly appreciate a full dining experience. Lately going out we have been disappointed in the lack of service at so many restaurants. We went in with no expectations other than it looked good on yelp. When you initially look at the menu and the descriptions, it automatically creates a high expectation for the food. I can say that there were 0 disappointments the entire night! We received exceptional service and excellent food! We ordered the Simple Green Salad (far from simple, DELICIOUS LIGHT DRESSING), The Prince Edward Island Mussels (PERFECTLY cooked- all mussels opened and not chewy at all!), The Grilled Lamb Loin, and Seared Red Snapper Veracruz Style- BOTH so unique and flavorful! For Dessert we had the bread pudding (best I have ever had in my life!)  The waiter was extremely personable and the manager came over multiple times to ensure that we were having a great experience. I have respect for this establishment- there are two types of people in this world, people who work for the paycheck and people who work because they love and care about what they do. This staff works for their wonderful reputation.You can tell that the Red Owl Tavern's employees try to establish a relationships with their guests, rather than just trying to flip tables and want to be hospitable. The manager was in communication with us the entire night, ensuring we were having a great experience, as well as the waiter being prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down to when we left.

The sushi was delicious, the soup/salad were great, and we loved the steak/shrimp/chicken...even the owner came over to say hello and make a joke about how his hands are tired from massaging all the beef lol!!

We walked in and were quickly asked ""Sushi or Hibachi?"".  The place is physically set up to serve Sushi on one side and the Hibachi tables are on the other side.  We said Hibachi which I thought meant individual tables and a back room kitchen made meal.  I was pleasantly surprised to be shown to one of those U shaped tables with the hot grill in the middle, a la Arigato's, Kobe's and a host of other Japanese Teppanyaki style cooking.  Ahhh, this is going to be good. We were a little earlier than the lunch crowd and it looked like the sushi side of the house was doing well.  Our side had 3 hibachi tables fully seated and the chef's doing their thing...ie egg into the hat, onion choo choo, etc.  
I chose Beef and Chicken and asked for only vegetables, no rice.  After all the fancy cooking, the metal spatulas and knives flying around, I got Beef and Chicken, vegetables and rice.  Later on, the manager and head Hibachi supervisor apologized time and time again.  No big deal.  I brought most of the rice home anyway for our granddaughter.  However, I noted one thing.  Don't be at the wrong end of the table.  It seemed the other folks to my right got decent portions of each item, I ended up with what was left, which appeared slightly less on the beef, chicken and vegetables.  Also, I asked for medium cooked on the beef, others asked for well done.  The beef went on and came off the grill at the same time, so how was mine any different from their's.

Tahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.

I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one

My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.

I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.

Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.

Their specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!

The service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).

My fianc√© and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. 

Kanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. 

I couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!",2011-02-14 22:08:53,Kanella,1001 Spruce St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9463322,-75.1579478,4.5,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

Came in for breakfast right after opening at 10AM, service was prompt and thankfully it wasn't too crowded. I imagine that you have to make reservations relatively early given the size of the place and popularity though.

Ordered the Greek coffee for myself which was tiny (not sure if that's how it's supposed to be) but still tasty and unique with the coffee grounds in the cup. My friend ordered the Greek frappe which was creamy and delicious, will definitely get that next time. Got the Shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich, especially since I opted for the additional sausage. Was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness. My friend got the Cypress Breakfast which she said was delicious as well.

And this place is truly divine. 

I had a kedegree platter for brunch, and the rice was seasoned full of life and the veggies and fish were both extra fresh! I normally don't drink anything than water, but the mint tea + lemonade (lemonanna) was too intriguing to pass up, and boy I'm glad I splurged. That had to be one of the finest blends of balance I've had in a drink. 

I had always thought that this place was exorbitantly expensive, but my meal was actually very affordable for brunch. Dinner is still pricey.

1231,1474,qA4va1zHT8hNmOj09in_bQ,mUIBtlWNPD7sz3rGGWQ1RA,1,"Kanella carries a well-deserved reputation as a prime brunch spot in Philly. Luck smiled on my party of three, as we snagged a last-minute reservation at noon (you should plan further in advance than we did). I echo other reviewers' sentiments concerning the decor at Kanella; as I walked in, the antique exposed brick and blue/white color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the Cycladic Islands. Chef Pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically Mediterranean hospitality. He checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed, and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned Kanella a return visit on that merit alone.

That isn't to downplay his Cypriot fare; the food is absolutely delicious. One can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored, and Kanella's vibrant, rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore one's faith in brunch. We commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio, which served up pumpkin-feta, spicy tomato, and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba. Each scored high marks from the table, with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting briny-earthy-sweet interplay. 

Other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg, potatoes with tzatziki, and a special lamb tongue stew. Though small in portion, the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but ever-so-slightly-creamy fried egg crowning well-seasoned, toothsome greens in yogurt sauce. The potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards, and paired beautifully with accompanying minty, rich tzatziki. The tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender, pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce. With a squeeze of lemon juice, a dollop of accompanying Greek yogurt, and a last-minute side order of extra grilled pita, the dish served as a hearty, memorable combination of flavors and textures.

For a change of pace in the Philly dining scene, or simply for Chef Pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazy-good plates, head to Kanella and get whisked away to the Aegean for an hour or so.",2013-10-15 18:34:34,Kanella,1001 Spruce St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9463322,-75.1579478,4.5,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

We began with a shared plate of dips and bread. The dips were really special hummus style and change - we had beet (beautiful color, nice earthy taste), sardine (a bit fishy for my taste, but the rest of my party devoured it) and a third veggie one (my favorite). 

I had the smoked cod with basmati rice and boiled egg. Though it isn't a traditional brunch meal, it was a great meal with good flavors and the right portions. 

My mom went with the featured Cyprus breakfast and what looked like hash browns is actually a greek styled cheese, very delish. I would recommend this dish for those looking for brunch fare.

They do the meze/chef's tasting (no other options).  $35 for meat and $30 for vegetarian options.  Between two of us, we split one of each so we could try everything.  We did not regret it!

The meze is basically a tapas-style meal - where they serve about 5-6 tapas per order.  By the end of the night, we couldn't even keep track of what we had eaten.  Everything was flavorful, the right mixture of rich for certain dishes and light for more vegetarian options.  We tried octopus, lamb, chicken, bison... just the range was very impressive.  And we loved that they served most richer dishes on a bed of salad, or something else complimentary to the tastebuds.

 Sitting behind us was a group of regulars who come every Sunday, which we noticed right away and took it as a good sign.  

Service was great - servers were attentive and sat us right away at a table outside even though we had no reservations and had no idea they had a chef's tasting that night.  They just kept coming out with more and more food, so if you come, be prepared to be stuffed.

Good thing too, because every table was full. Since this is a BYOB, we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table. As I looked around, every other table had ice for their wine. I had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table. He took our wine and put it over on a window sill. This was a little strange, but it only got worse. We didn't know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us. We spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine. Not exactly how I wanted to spend my bday dinner. Its especially frustrating because this is a BYOB restaurant, you'd think this wouldnt have been an issue. Besides this, the service was fine. They also accommodate to the gluten free people out there.

Onto the food. We started with dips of the day, very authentic and tasty. I ordered the braised rabbit leg. I thought the meat itself was fine.

Kanella simply offers classic, rustic dishes made with fresh, often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food. You'll see him buzzing around the dining room, advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them. Might come off as heavy-handed, but this guy knows exactly what he's doing. 

Biggest hits for me include the whole fish (or any filet on the menu), duck breast and pork loin. For dessert, it's always the galaktobureko. Heaven.

The manager and wait staff may possibly be the worst I have ever encountered, rude and definitely not focused on customer service.  The manager is a very angry hostile fella I asked if I could get brown rice instead of white and he blasted me...I offered to pay extra and he stormed off? Do not know what the deal was but this is just plain unprofessional and creepy behavior. The waitresses will smack into you while you are eating...man what a mess this place is from top to bottom.
The food just OK at best! I am seriously complimenting them here... you can do better at home than here. Seriously I am not going to go into you have been warned just yuk...OK? these other folks with the positive reviews for this place must burn off their taste buds with adult beverages. (Didn't try the sake it may be the high point of the joint...but why would I want to expose my taste buds to a substandard meal to enjoy some rice wine? I can do this at home.
 Here is something I am not sure of, I have only lived here a few months now, is it customary to charge for each soda every time you get a refill here? I was charged for each I asked why they said ""This is how we do it here."" So at $2 bucks per 6-8 ounces of beverage you may want to go with water at this place...but smarter yet! Go elsewhere.
I will not be returning to this establishment.

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

Fluffy yet firm, but not overcooked. The basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs. The biscuits were pretty much out of this world.

It is very eclectic with random decor and music.

The bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough.

I ordered the Big Jerk sandwich and the Caprese, but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich, which they had no problem doing. Both were good with the Caprese stealing the show.

The food:
The Big Jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender (pork). It was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce. The caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side. The pickle spear that came with it was not your standard ""dill spear"". It is homemade and very fresh, just lacking a little zest, but still good.
The caprese rocked. The balsamic reduction, cubes of Moz, diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination. I will definitely get that again but next time I will ask them to scale back on the size. Way more than I needed.

Now for the good stuff: The house beer, ""Phat Beer"". I'm not big on IPA's or local brews, but this one has won my heart. Somewhere twixt a Bud and Bud Light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue.

The only reason Phat's didn't get five stars was because of the Big Jerk. They need to freshen that up a little.

Phat's needs to upgrade/separate the restrooms. The women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind. They also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis.

Literally that's all I can say about this place. I went twice in one weekend! I'm literally obsessed. So where do I begin?

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. 

There is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don't want to miss out on this new restaurant.

The staff encourages this relaxed feeling, we never felt pressure to eat and run.  Instead they offered frequent top-offs for our coffee and water.  
Dana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.

After my initial unfavorable experience at Moto, Antonio the manager messaged me here on yelp, invited me back, and assured me that this time would be different. 

No longer a fresh face here on M Street and long ago rid of its growing pains... This restaurant is officially my new ""go to."" 

They DO NOT charge per glass of ice tea. My first time here, apparently, was simply the victim of an inexperienced waitress. 

I ordered the chicken piccata (amazing) and my husband ordered Wagyu Filet (and I stole a bite).

My husband, quite the connoisseur of steak here in the gulch- having eaten at Watermark, Adeles and Sambucca- has declared this steak: ""Best in the Gulch!"" 

He asked that I quote him in this review, so here goes ""It's my 'perfect' but 'perfect' is relative. To be more descriptive it's cooked true to order, excellent flavor, very tender and much better than your average filet."" 

I am so very glad I gave them a second chance. Even having the manager personally reach out to us in effort to right a wrong speaks volumes about this restaurant's quality and customer care. 

This is a ""must try"" for all gulch residents and all who visit.

My husband and I went to Moto on a date night, not a special occasion. I enjoyed my glass of Sangiovese, and my husband enjoyed his cocktail. He had a pasta dish with a creamy tomato sauce and sausage, which was good, but tasted like a rather pedestrian Italian pasta dish. Take away the pretty dishes and beautiful table, and I think it was just about as good as any other creamy tomato pasta with sausage dish. My entr√©e was a black bucatini with seafood. The bucatini was good, and sauce was appropriately light and spicy. And the shrimp was pretty well cooked - something that does not happen all the time in Nashville. But the pasta was light on seafood. When lobster is listed on the menu, I want to see and taste the lobster! We also got a half order of the grilled artichoke hearts, which were very well cooked. We shared a dessert, a spicy peanut tart, which was interesting. The restaurant is beautiful, very modern, very hipster Nashville, very dark. The service was great. Really, truly - everyone was very helpful and nice and informed about the menu. So, it really wasn't a terrible meal. But it wasn't one of the better Italian meals I've in Nashville.

Pros: Birra Morretti on tap, sexy menu, chic decor, good service, octopus appetizer, squid ink pasta

Cons: Carpaccio is one of my favorite foods and this was not very good at all (no crostini, horseradish or arugula for one thing...and I don't know where the ""Italian kimchi"" was but of that is a play on words regarding the roasted capers then I'm not sure I follow their line of thinking -- kimchi is fermented cabbage after all), sticks on sticks on sticks of butter is used in preparation of the Carbonara which totally drowned out the taste of the guanciale and I didn't see the value at all in adding corn to the dish, Brussels sprouts are just okay but what's worse is that you smell like them for 2 days (I didn't even eat them the second time around and I still smell them today!), mushroom/fontina/truffle pizza and the Quattro formaggi/pancetta were too rich for my blood.

1327,1598,gVMGuWs0LbJq6drWqf5e7A,N5ekxQd7wGHWJJK-p9qqXw,0,"TL;DR -- Overpriced ""nickel and diming"" with mediocre cuisine and mediocre service.

Our party of six was attracted to Moto by their ads for ""Moto Mondays"", which is a tasting menu with a  flight of wine for $25.  

Upon being escorted to our table, they stepped on one of my pet peeves which is immediately trying to up-sell us on Pellegrino vs ""tap water"".  We were fine with tap water, which was served European style-- lukewarm with no ice.  Since it was 83 degrees outside with 70% humidity, we found this unsatisfactory and had to request ice.

When we asked about the tasting menu, we were told that the serving sizes were very small and we should get something else.  I find it obnoxious that a restaurant advertises a special and then when you get there they try to convince you not to order it!  ""It will never satisfy you!""  Then why are you selling it!?  If the answer is ""bait and switch"", then it's  a fake deal.  It tells me you don't want repeat business.

Everyone else in my party ordered something else, but I stuck with the tasting menu.  After all, that's why I showed up.  True to the waitress's warning, the three dishes which comprised the tasting menu failed to satisfy.  There was a tiny crudo (raw whitefish with rock salt) paired with a heavy red, a tiny mushroom pizza paired with a sparkling rose, and a thick piece of toast with a thin layer of prosciutto paired with a riesling.  In that order. 

The flight of wine was lower quality, didn't pair well with the  food, and the servings were miserly splashes.

The crudo was so over-salted that I had a hard time eating it and it made no sense with the red.  I'd just started on the mushroom pizza when the waitress dropped by to ask if everything ""tasted wonderful"".  I said that the mushroom pizza was nice, but that the fish was too salty.  She replied, ""here, we love our food salty"".  I don't think that insulting your guest's palate is a great customer service technique.  

To sum up, the tasting menu, far from being a chef's calling card, an opportunity to experience something fun and creative, was a half baked and poorly executed marketing exercise-- and a terrible value to boot.    No one else in my party was particularly impressed with their dishes either.  The phrase ""not bad but overpriced"" came up a lot.  I wound up embarrassed that I'd suggested the place.

As a final insult, Moto's enforces mandatory 20% tipping.

Moto Monday ensured that I won't be back for Tuesday through Sunday.",2016-07-15 01:40:46,Moto Cucina + Enoteca,1120 McGavock St,Nashville,TN,37203,36.1559332768,-86.7864618589,4.0,1,2,,,1,1,0,0,0,0

Both times we were seated in the front of the restaurant, in a corner booth on the window.  I recommend trying for a table in that area if you want something a little more private/quiet! 

The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful, and during our second trip they somehow ""remembered"" us from our first visit months earlier - commenting on the date we were last there and seating us at the same booth. I couldn't quite decide if it was creepy or impressive. We're obviously in some kind of database, no one has that good of a memory of a one time guest!

The food was fabulous both times! I had the blueberry lasagna the first time because I was just too curious not to.  Don't let the name fool you, it's a mushroom lasagna with a blueberry balsamic drizzled on. Delicious, but incredibly rich.

My son and daughter tried it first and loved the food so my husband and I dropped in last Sat. night to try it out. We sat at the counter and before we even sat down, the proprietor was at our elbow asking what we would like to drink. Saki and beer came back to us by the time we sat down. I ordered edamame and a Crystal Shrimp roll. My husband ordered the tempura Shrimp and Vegetables.The first thing I noticed about the roll that it did not have a ton of rice rolled around it, in fact, it had a very thin layer of rice which was nice because I was able to taste all the ingrediants without fighting through a ton of rice. The roll was delicious! Next my edamame came--hot, perfectly cooked but the dish would have been enhanced with more salt, I think. After my dishes were out and eaten, my husband's shrimp and vegetables came. What a delicious dish!. The shrimp were perfectly cooked with a miasma of light, not greasy, delicate batter. And the portion was healthy--at least six very large shrimp. The vegetables were perfectly cooked! Again covered with delicious batter. The tempura sauce was a little thick and candy like. I would have liked something a little lighter to match the delicacy of the dish. To avoid picking at my husband's dinner, I ordered another roll (and another Saki!). I took a gamble with the long roll ""Why Not"". It was a perfect gamble. The filling was tasty with a subtle brighteness of lemon about 2 secs after you started chewing....a surprise that kept me going back to experience it again with each subsequent bite. 
 
They do have an all you can eat menu. We were not that hungry and ended a la carte. Walked away feeling nicely sated (not  bloated with rice). We would definitely come back again! They have a punch card that offers you freebies after so many visits and you eat FREE on your birthday!

1386,1667,71L_YVQmtMksii5Bz2P1SA,z680Aylt8wN2KAeFM1hy-A,0,"Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.

And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. 

Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.",2010-01-08 16:26:03,Chatham Tap Mass.

It exceeded all my expectations, especially because we walked by and stopped in without knowing anything about it. We were strolling around this neighborhood called ""The Gulch"" and thought to check it out. The restaurants all around it were rowdy pickup joints with screaming twenty-somethings drinking margaritas and this was a welcome relief. The bar has a beautiful view and we took advantage of it. 

We sat at the bar and had the deep fried buttermilk quail app. It was so delicious I wanted another. We were not convinced we were going to stay for dinner until the last bite of the quail changed our minds.

We both had the prixe fixe menu with wine pairing and ordered one of each of the choices. The grits souffle was DECADENT!!!!! I cannot begun to describe the flavor! Our dinners were superior. The filet was cooked perfectly and the chicken was heavenly and moist. The gnocchi side dish was light, flavorful and amazing. Whoever cooked it should be teaching chefs across the country.  Desserts came next. The panna cotta was rather unremarkable but the rocky road terrine left us fighting for the last bite.

Food temperature is important to me and I was not disappointed. The moment the food came out it want directly in front of us. Our bartender Josh was great about letting us change up the wine pairings. In addition, he was friendly and attentive.

It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  

I am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!",2017-08-16 15:51:51,Zaxby's Chicken Fingers & Buffalo Wings,11619 W Hillsborough Ave,Tampa,FL,33635,28.0146920537,-82.6140054742,3.0,1,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

1427,1730,wZrWIlELwUjhEOUZRA4JEQ,0wQCEcpZ57TmTm6EmEDsIw,1,"We made the journey through the cold and snow, all the way out to St Charles, with our friends the D's to try Hendricks BBQ.  We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.

We had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which ""meats"" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.

Hendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.

Next for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.

The brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.

Turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  

The sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is ""the Power of Pine Sol, Baby"" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.

Sides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  

The only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.

Hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.",2013-02-23 14:58:27,Hendricks BBQ,1200 S Main St,St Charles,MO,63301,38.7713448,-90.4865593,3.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

I wasn't sure what I'd find at Hendricks but I was pleasantly surprised as I was driving through the neighborhood. I liked the small town feel. Since I was by myself, I had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside, I had to stay to enjoy the decor. Light bulbs in mason jars, flat screen TV's and an amazing lighted patio. Although the view is just a parking lot, it's too bad it wasn't closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at. 

I ordered pork steak (which I've never heard of before) and it was really good. It looked like a T-bone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork. For my sides, I chose collard greens and cole slaw. The cole slaw was awesome. I have a weird ritual where I always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it. This one is definitely in my top 5. The slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it, which I love. I usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect. Cold and with a kick. Collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too.

We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  

For our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  

Dessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.",2009-10-13 23:05:04,Sl√°inte Pub & Grill,3000 Market St,Philadelphia,PA,19104,39.954815805,-75.1836068183,3.5,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

First I appreciated that because we were on a guest list I didn't have to pay a cover, get frisked or have my handbag rummaged through. I was however scared to death to descend the the very steep staircase that led to the private room teetering on my heels. I held the railing for dear life.

Once downstairs I have to say that I was sorely disappointed with the space. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Just a hodgepodge of tables and chairs, some random booth seats and a bar. No decor, nothing that gave you the specialness of being in a private space. Me and my party pal felt like we had just been shoved into someone's basement.

SPANISH FRIES

And if you've had them (with melted cheddar of course, not that greezy spray-on cheese) you'll know why they deserve all capitals and a separate paragraph...effin' amazing. jalapeno peppers, cooked onions, melted cheddar, and old bay...this much fried goodness should be one of the seven deadly sins...

On top of that the hurricanes and pink lemonades margaritas kick-ass (get a double, it's more like a triple...boo-yah!!), the pomegranate margarita is quite delctable as well, in fact its hard to go wrong with their flavored margaritas....on second thought stay away from the mango, it kinda reminds me of cough syrup with a lollipop left in it

They added a downstairs which helps with overflow, but lacks the bright open airiness of upstairs, and kind of feels like being on punishment when all of the cool (and early) people hog up the space by the upstairs bar. But fret not, the food is just as good and the drinks are never weak.

Surrey's is allegedly the best breakfast in New Orleans. Yelpers talk about it like it will change your life.

I don't understand, and I never will.

I've eaten at Surrey's three times in the past year, and each time my order has been borderline inedibly disgusting. I have eaten there with multiple dining companions, and they have all, to a man, in each instance found their own meals to be borderline inedibly disgusting. I've started to ask people I know, ""Hey, have you ever eaten at Surrey's?"" They always reply, ""I hate that place. The food is awful.""

I will offer an example. The huevos rancheros deluxe. The actual huevos rancheros base is flavorless. My over easy eggs were, in my most generous interpretation, over medium. The conservative helping of goat cheese (allegedly a main ingredient in the deluxe) was extremely low quality, smelling and tasting of goat the way very low quality goat cheese is wont to do. The lox had (surprise!) apparently been marinated in some kind of lime mixture, plus had been heated, possibly sauteed. The whole thing was *covered* in capers. Take a moment to imagine these flavor combinations. And it cost $13.

We were told a 40-minute wait around 10:45 on a Friday morning. We waited over an hour (aren't hosts supposed to overestimate wait times, not under?).

The wait wasn't worth it. For a place that boasts about their homemade breads, it's shocking they don't have better than smuckers jelly packets to pair with their baked goods. The shrimp and grits was good but not great, and the bread served with it was legitimately bad. Dry, crusty, literally just stale slices adorning the plate. My partner got a breakfast burrito - it was meh, nothing special.

I got a juice given their namesake and it tasted like concentrate!!!! It was a special, orange-pineapple-mango. I would not get a juice unless you're looking for a glass of sugar.

First off, they open at 8AM, so your best bet is getting there at 8AM. Each time I finished my meal at 9, there was an hour already to be seated. This place is pretty small, and considering how good it is, everyone wants to eat here. Do yourself a favor and wake up early to be served within a reasonable time. 

Ive had the Costa Rican and Banana Foster French Toast. Both were wonderful, but the french toast was OUT OF THIS WORLD. My god, the combination of the creamy, sweet flavors exploded like fireworks in my mouth. I didnt want to stop wating it was that good! If you want something sweet, please order this. The Costa Rican had all fresh ingredients, blended well together, left me pretty full. The rice was a little funny tasting, but I dont think I was use to how they make it. It wasnt that big of a deal mixed with everything else. I also tried some of my friend's biscuits and gravy. It was really good, even for something I normally would not order.

1488,1791,LEPLQeZh436XbCPzLVqsnA,vN6v8m4DO45Z4pp8yxxF_w,1,"This caf√© is one of my favorite breakfast/ brunch spots anywhere. The Banana Foster's French Toast is unbelievable. I loved everything about it. The toast is very soft and sweet. The banana cream inside and the Banana Foster sauce on top are incredible. They are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. I devoured the entire dish quickly. I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:

Top 4 French Toasts:

1. Blue Moon Caf√© in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.

2. Blu Jam Caf√© (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.

3. Surrey Caf√© and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.

I also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.

4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Caf√© and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.

good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.

Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. 

The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. 

I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as ""the best food item"" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. 

I look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!",2016-01-04 04:42:19,Seasons Cafe & Bakery,7261 US Hwy 19 N,Pinellas Park,FL,33781,27.838462,-82.682464,4.0,0,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

There's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).
I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before.

By the way, it's buy 5 get 1 free.  To our pleasant surprise, this place also serves some popular dishes, such as bun Bo hue (spicy noodle soup), pho, beef stew (bo kho), etc.  We ordered these dishes and they were authentic Vietnamese.   The place was spic and span, including the bathroom.  Since we were there around 11AM and probably were their first customers of the day, we don't know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day.  As for banh mi, we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches, as they were not going to be consumed right away.  The folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when we're ready to eat.  Nice touch!!!  The meats for the sandwiches at Seasons Cafe and Bakery were in good quantity, which puts the banh mi shops in Northern VA to shame.

We were not disappointed!  We did the grilled chicken bahn mi and the Brian's Special (grilled pork with egg).  Both were on wonderfully fresh bread, loaded with lightly pickled daikon and carrot (I could eat these veggies by the pound).  The filling to bread ratio was good and my dining buddies appreciated that the herbs and jalepenos came on the side.  I appreciated it too since I ended up with everyone's cilantro.  

The Child Who Eats Almost Nothing (seriously, she won't eat chicken) decided Pho sounded good.  When her tummy got full, we ended up with about half the portion.  As we were eating, we noticed some interesting ingredients in the Pho and asked her what she had told the cashier when she ordered.  She's never been one for bothering to read very closely or taking out her ear buds when ordering and apparently she requested with everything - including tripe and tendon.  When we pointed this out, she shrugged and said ""Oh, I wondered what that was.  Tasted pretty good"".

Trip One:
It was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.

I'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.

Trip Two (two days after trip one):
My boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.

We spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.

In short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!",2012-12-04 16:19:25,Grand Isle,575 Convention Center Blvd,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.9475671,-90.0651152,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

All the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control. I have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion. Some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area... Are yall serious? It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product.

The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can't fault them for that.

The customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn't seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I'm just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.

That being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn't a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder.

The croissants were okay (too dense for my taste). They had good flavor, and somehow tasted better the day after. I liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant, but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery. The ham and cheese croissant was delicious. The Nutella croissant was okay (good flavor but the croissant was hard and didn't have enough filling). The butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant. The almond croissant lacked flavor.

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with saut√©ed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough saut√©ed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested.

I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  ""BBQ sauce"" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.

The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  

I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.

We were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back. 

Around this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.

We figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.

One person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, ""we're busy"". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.

It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions.

I heard such good things about this place and since we were checking out a band next door last night, we thought we'd go in and try this local soul food restaurant people have been raving about.

I went in with a small group of four. We stood by the door waiting to be seated for a good 5 minutes. But no staff was in sight. So we thought maybe this is one of those establishments where you seat yourself... So we did.

We sat close to the front and waited. Finally, a waiter came into the room. He looked right at us and kept walking - OK, guess we're not at his station. We waited again. Another waiter came in, she acknowledged us, but never came over. A third waiter came in - we must have been seated for 15 minutes at this point and still no service has come to the table -- not even to give us a ""I'll be right back"" explanation - he apparently wasn't our waiter either.

At this time another couple walked in - it looked like they were deciding whether they liked the place (it has a ""dive restaurant"" feel to it). One waiter sees the couple and points to a table for them to sit at. The couple still talking amongst themselves did not see the waiter signaling (why didn't he just walk up to them? Makes no sense). The waiter says, very loudly and rudely with an annoyed tone and expression, ""heeelllloooo!"" When they heard that, they left... And so did we because still, nobody had came to our table and we didn't want to miss our band because of some sub-par waiters who were struggling to handle a half empty dining room.

Solid fried chicken. Reminds me of my dad's best friend's pizza shop in East Los Angels (R.I.P. Rocky's Pizza), as in lightly floured and then fried so that the crispness is all in the skin, no breading.

The cornbread was delicious, not too dry, with a serving of unnecessary whipped butter that I used anyway. Red beans were terrible. Simply too thick with the consistency of refried beans, and no flavor; I had to add so much freaking hot sauce and it just got absorbed. The collards were alright; tender but still somewhat bitter. 

Contrary to other reviews, I thought the service was fine, although just a little slow.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by an energetic, friendly woman (Lilly herself?). It was like dining at the home of your favorite aunt; she was pleasantly chatty, enthusiastic, and attentive.

We started out with the spring rolls, which were light and refreshing (these are the ones with soft rice paper, not fried). For our main course I had the grilled beef vermicelli and my girlfriend got the shrimp salad. I'm usually skeptical of ordering salads at Asian restaurants because they often seem to be throw-aways designed to make the menu more friendly to a western eye, but this one was delicious. The shrimp were grilled perfectly and it had a great sweet-spicy-smoky dressing (wish I knew what was in it).

Some people have no clue how to eat Vietnamese food.  Lilly's is packed for lunch,  I've definitely never seen so many white people at a Vietnamese restaurant, and a good many of them seem clueless about Viet food but determined to eat it nonetheless.  That's a spirit worthy of admiration.  Now if they would actually try a bit of the sauce instead of eating plain dry vermicelli, or use the soup spoon when they eat pho, they would get a lot more out of the experience.  Perhaps the server should explain a bit or have a quick intro written into the menu. 

I was glad I got the vermicelli instead of the pho, which did not look appetizing.  The vermicelli was good.  But again, compared to other cities, the food is about average and a few dollars overpriced.  But you would be paying for the clean and modern atmosphere over the sticky floor and tacky setup of your average Viet place.",2013-01-28 05:14:45,Lilly's Cafe,1813 Magazine St,New Orleans,LA,70130,29.932123,-90.0735046315,4.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

I walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.

The service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.

My most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.

If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here.

Let's just get it out of the way, the tacos are pretty legit. I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey, but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9, so the price point isn't too far off. 

What separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention, there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food. 

I ordered:
-fried mahi mahi
-carnita
-carne

all were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar, not bottle), so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice, added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.

Here were the misses...

1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3. 
2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA
3. we showed him the ""rewards"" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount. 

When we paid, i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying ""they just opened, must be oversight"". BUT, my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well. 

ALso, i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did? I had to ask for another tray, which wasn't a problem, but inconvenient considering we ordered ""separately"" but paid all together.",2015-10-17 21:07:25,Buena Onda,1901 Callowhill St,Philadelphia,PA,19130,39.9609147337,-75.1708267829,4.0,1,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,1

Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that's when I noticed something wasn't right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a ""closed-system"" and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn't the first time he's heard this from a customer.

Purchased my 10oz glass of wine & bottled water ($18.50 total. Ouch!) at the bar, and walked in with them in hand as one reviewer suggested. Got seated in freshly wiped seats (saw the guy cleaning & it smelled like bleach), and 3-4 servers began to take orders from the room. They were really hustling!

I did notice that there aren't any call buttons like I have experienced at other similar luxury theaters. There didn't appear to be a mid-movie service either.

Their menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.
Chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!
When our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick ""sorry"" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.
As for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.  
I will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.",2017-01-14 23:17:25,Anaya's Mexican Restaurant,1285 N State Rd 135,Greenwood,IN,46142,39.6344705,-86.1569734,3.5,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

Awful coffee. Just awful.

Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.

They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.

There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience

And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.

Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked.

This place is cheap and the portion sizes are what is expected! I ordered the bahn mi with everything on it as starter and I was very pleased at how good it tasted and pricing about 2.50 something per sandwich you can't beat that! In the sandwich was liver pate, butter mayo whatever that good yellow sauce is, pork meat, pickled carrots and daikon radishes, cilantro, and jalepenos! One thing I did not like was how salty the pork tasted but I still ate the sandwich anyways. The bread was perfectly toasted and crusty, just the way bahn mi should taste! Also, to go alongside with my sandwich I got me a honeydew bubble tea. Man was this bubble tea awesome and flavorful and just the right consistency and the tapioca balls even were cooked just the way it should! 

Next, I ordered the pho with beef and meatballs. OMG, I forgot how good this pho tasted like the last time I ate here years ago. The bowl was huge for just about $7. This price and portion beats Thai Papaya down in the Antioch area. And even my daughter enjoyed at how good the texture of the rice noodles were! I usually add in hoisin sauce, sriracha, and whatever condiments are on the table depending on what I crave. But the pho broth without all the other added extra stuff is good without it!

The pho tai here is very good with a dense and textured broth. There isn't a wide selection of Vietnamese restaurants in Nashville, and Kien Giang manages to have the best pho for the area. 

The restaurant itself is a bit dive-y and the staff isn't overly friendly. Nothing of-putting by any means . . .  but be prepared, it feels more like going to a diner than fine dining. 

What sets Kien Giang apart is their pho take-out! They just kill it. Packing up boiling hot soup and all the accouterments takes a certain amount of smarts, and they really get the job done.

Cold Noodles in Chili Oil: I learned that the taste of the cold noodles depends on the master chef. IMHO, the master chef at the U City location makes a better cold noodle in chili oil dish

We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.

Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.

My roommate and I were craving sushi and were recommended to come here by Yelp and a friend so we decided to give it a shot. 

First off, they get bonus points for serving FREE edemame as an appetizer. I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it.

Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty. 

The other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy.

As expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

Service was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.

He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience.

It's like a mix of a place where you can drink beer all night, have breakfast in or drink hot tea in the afternoon. Whatever it is, it's got pretty great stuff!!! They have some beer flavors off the tap that I've never heard of before like ""Strawberry Shortcake Lager"" (which was what I tried). It was good, smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them. I also had a taste of their pear cider (which you can also get off tap) and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good. Not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat. And with the ciders you won't feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldn't really know if you're starting to get tipsy or not.

Large rotating craft beer selection with and even superior bar staff that's friendly, knowledgeable, and locals themselves you'll quickly come to realize why this is my tampa go to bar.  Before moving to Seminole heights I was living in temple Terrace and didn't mind driving here just for a beer because of the atmosphere, the people, and the food.  

-Cool people ranging from hipsters-business professionals: check
-Beer: check (double check since they offer a great craft selection)
-atmosphere with a great outdoor patio where the neighborhood meets: check
-food (which is not your typical low quality bar food) while not a requirement for me has come in handy on the nights I end up spending 3+ hrs here lost in conversation: check

 
Overall it's my favorite bar in tampa.  Alas it's not anything like what I long for, which is a divey bar like Mt Royal Tavern in Baltimore, it certainly has picked up the gauntlet of being my go to everyday bar since I've moved.

We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left.

It is in a great location, quiet, peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees. For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. 
Based on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.
For the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.

The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. 

We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their ""fancy"" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! 

The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.

I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones.

There is a super old rustic feel to the decor, and the bear hide hanging across the wall really completes this place as an old rustic tavern for weary travellers...but in this case, it was more for locals and tourists. 

The food was interesting as we ordered the rabbit, the elk, and venison meats! To my surprise, nothing was gamey and the meat was actually tender and juicy.

Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties, cheeses, toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day. 

The last time we were there, my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese. He was knocked to the floor, and has been telling everyone about it ever since. I got a simple beef patty with cheese and BBQ sauce. Maybe I need to be a bit more adventurous next time! Nonetheless, I still loved my burger.

Another great thing about 500 Degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil. It's just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy French fries. 

I've always had stellar service here. I loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what I wanted off of the menu. I blame it on the rain brain.

My only gripe about 500 Degrees is that it can get a little pricey. For burgers, fries and drinks for 2, we paid about $28. That included one Kobe beef patty, but even without it, you're going to pay a sit-down price for what is really a take-out burger.

Had a wonderful first impression.  Clean and modern with a friendly, attentive hostess.  The saxophonist was a nice plus.  I prefer a little ""harder"" jazz, but he was very talented and this is perfect dining music for most people, and my friends and I enjoyed it very much.  They informed me there is a jazz jam upstairs on Sunday nights; I will be there.
I am glad I had experienced ""guides"" with me.  I probably would have chosen something else if both of my friends (who had not previously gone to Sylvia's together) had not gone on and on (and on) about the pork chops.  I thought it would blasphemy to try something else.  Boy, they were right.  I had two pork chops so I could try both the fried AND the smothered.  They were both delicious and both completely different.  The fried was perfectly battered, not greasy at all, nicely flavored, and very tender.  The smothered was a wonderful, slow-cooked fall apart piece of heaven.  As it was all way too much for me to finish at one sitting, I will be enjoying the smothered pork today.
I had the mashed potatoes and collard greens.  Both were excellent and hot.  I asked for vinegar with my collards before tasting them, but they were wonderfully flavored without it so I didn't use it.  Mashed potatoes (with gravy) were excellent.  I am not a big fan of some of the sides that my friends got, but everyone wanted to share so I tried the sweet potatoes (excellent) and the tomatoes and okra (surprising good).  
I am not a big fan of corn bread, either, but they came to the table warm, slightly sweet, and moist.  Excellent.  
None of us had room for dessert, but our friend said we had to have the sweet potato pie and ordered us all an order to go.  I have another friend who raves about their peach cobbler.  I can't personally report, yet.
Service was very friendly and attentive, yet did not hover.  
As this was a Friday night, we went a few blocks north to hit 3 Daughters, have a beer and watch some live music afterwards.  I love what is happening on 22nd Street.  
Will definitely come back and try some other items on the menu!",2014-10-11 14:28:02,Sylvia's Queen of Soul Food,642 22nd St S,St Petersburg,FL,33712,27.763513,-82.662551,3.5,0,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,1

The real upsetting part of this meal was we had a vegan in our party and they asked the waitress what on the menu was vegan and she pointed out all the tofu dishes.  Ok good start!  Both the meat eaters and on meat eaters in our party have options.  The follow up question she asked was  that there were absolutely no animal products in any of the tofu dishes?  The answer she got was no animal products.  After ordering the tofu vermicelli she found out it had fish sauce on it and told the waitress.  The waitress sort of stared at her blankly and didn't really know what to do.  Eventually we just asked to see the menu again and asked if the  sate veggies was vegan?  The waitress explained it was veggies with a lemongrass and spicy sauce.  The waitress said yes it was vegan.  She sked if they could make It less spicy, and was told yes. And so asked if she could have that instead.  When it came out it was steamed veggies with rice.  No sauce, nothing.  Some of the veggies had brown spots on them.

Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer.

Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but I didn't really enjoy much about my visit. The waiter was very unpleasant - was banging down the plates and glasses on the table when he delivered them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better. 

We had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone. 

The worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.

Part of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back. There are so many good Italian restaurants worth visiting that the opportunity cost of returning to Casselli's seems too high.

And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love.

Today, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.

There were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It's just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn't bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I've ever eaten was much better. Even if it's pressed, I've never had cracker-like Cuban bread.

When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport.

The Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. 

We also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. 

The cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. 

It should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door.

I personally have tried every taco on the menu as well as the appetizers! Each taco uses fresh local ingredients with an option for vegetarians and meat eaters like myself.

We came between brunch and dinner, so ate at bar. Had a bottle of the ""best pizza wine""'and liked,it. Ordered two pizzas for the three of us. Plenty. And I eat a lot of pizza.

Pizza reminds me very much of Vetri, and similarly priced (expensive). Excellent ingredients. The style has a soft middle crust, almost white and underdone (to me) which apparently is authentic. Otherwise I would ask for a little more well done, but that might be an insult. You tuck and fold the middle to eat.  I mean, it's delicious, but I feel I shovel too much in that way and lose the individual taste of the fabulous toppings. The outside crust was  puffy and tender.

Nice bartender service and he was really runnng around. I think it was a surprisingly busy day downtown. The gelato is always amazing. I'm in a rut.

The manager was probably the worst of the experience. He told my gf he would ""upgrade her hummus for no charge, because normally it's $1.00"" but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor.  He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says, ""please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.""

It still took them 15 minutes to bring them out and it wasn't even that busy. After both drinks were gone we sat around waiting for the server to ask whether we needed anything else. Same experience the first time. The food is delicious, convinient location, and great atmosphere, I just hope they can get the staff together on the service.",2015-03-18 18:52:11,Nox Kitchen + Cocktails,"6370 N Campbell Ave, Ste 160",Tucson,AZ,85718,32.3220708,-110.9287346,3.5,0,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,1

I started off with the Vina Vino wine flight and my friends ordered The Bold and the Beautiful. Both came on a cute wood/chalkboard board with the wine written in chalk. All the wines were very tasty but the Vespucci  Primitivo and the Il Fauno di Arcanum were my favorite.

We then ordered the fig jam and prosciutto, bleu cheese, arugula flatbread. A little heavy on the blue cheese for my liking but overall was really good. We also ordered the Farmers Platter. You can choose anything from 1-7 items and build your plate from a variety of cheese and meats. We selected the Brillat-Savarin, Cypress Grove ""Purple Haze"", Blue Brie, Spressata and the Italian Speck. The farmers plate also came with jam, mustard,  caramelized nuts and crostini.

It is unique, somewhere between the Steve's (whole flat slice) and Jim's (chopped to death) presentation.  It works REALLY well, texture-wise.  Liscio's rolls were fresh and shiny, and the Wacky Wednesday deal of a large for six bucks was fortuitous. They usually have SOME kind of deal going though.. Meat was tasty and not gristly, the white American cheese melted like a dream (but short of the sauce that Steve's is.)  I got more meat than my son did, but both were acceptable portions.  Fried onions were 1/4 inch cubes, and caramelized beautifully.   Crinkle cut fries only get so good, but these were pipjng hot, and the Whiz that came on the side worked great on the sammy as well.  Lots of people on Yelp complained about the Whiz, but I could see it along with American as a great combo.Whiz is what Whiz is.

Possibly the REAL best thing here is the 1949 vibe.  This place is a time capsule, where only the prices have changed (and pretty minimally at that) over five decades.  Everything (including real fountain sodas) are made to order. Milkshakes (the half and half was very popular)  were killer.   Waitstaff is attentive and friendly as you are likely to find on the East Coast.  The accents tell you you;re not in Kansas, but the hospitality is sans atty-tude.  It really does transport you to another era,,

We got there 12:30 and were lucky to snag the last open booth.  Full of regulars, with good reason.  Parking is not easy, but there are plenty of side streets, keeping the walk down to an easy block or so.

It was well-worth the 20 minute ride from the Main Line to make this pilgrimage, and it certainly won't be a ""one-and-done"" experience.  I usually find some reason or other to venture up route 1 every month or so, and when I do, this will certainly be a set waypoint on my GPS.",2013-01-02 23:21:20,Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop,6030 Torresdale Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19135,40.0185131,-75.0581372,4.5,1,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

My thoughts are all over the place with the little details I love about this place, so let me try to focus on the sandwich and go from there. The menu is pretty tight with how you can get your steak here. There is no whiz (thank god) and the Pizza steak, Steak Hoagie, etc...where not listed (although they do serve hoagies, so maybe if asked nicely you could get one if that's your thing). Next thing to know is that they don't disguise their meat by chopping it up into fine little bits. This is sliced baby, and it is good. The real stand outs for me were the most amazing roll and the fantastic sauteed onions. Both components are easily the best I've yet to have in my travels around the city and made for a delicious gooey mess by the end of the roll.

The place itself has a great vibe. It is tiny and I can imagine fills up during those prime times. Its 5 cozy booths with individual jukeboxes surround a little soda fountain! The place was staffed today with 4 (including the cook) twenty-something girls who rocked the place. They were having fun and totally added to the uniqueness of the place.

At 8:15 we came back and our table was ready.  We sat down and were promptly served a nice cool glass of ice water.  My husband ordered an Italian Kiss which is some sort of espresso mixed drink.

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.

We celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.

We were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!

Since it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.

I couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, ""You have to try this NOW!""  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.

The heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.

Justin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.

I had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.

I was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)

I enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.  I absolutely cannot wait to head back for more fabulous food and support this new restaurant!",2011-08-25 18:36:29,Home Wine Kitchen,7322 Manchester Rd,Saint Louis,MO,63143,38.612765,-90.318053,4.0,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our server was awesome and well prepared.  Not once did we feel rushed.  It's not too often you're in a restaurant and you feel like you could sit there the whole night drinking wine and eating.  This place and our server did exactly that.  From the starter, to the main entree to the dessert everything was to die for and the service was impeccable!  

I started with the tomato soup while my friend started with the lamb meatballs.  The meatballs were AMAZING and the soup warmed me right up.  We both got the vegetable ragout and it was delicious.  I think every other mouthful came with a 'wow that's good' or 'there are so many flavors.'  I did appreciate how it wasn't too salty as well... or at least I couldn't tell it was.  And then dessert....apple bread pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I think that was the name of it anyway.  My friend and I almost came close to licking the plate!  We had wine by the glass and the pours are generous!!!   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a restaurant so much!

The staff seemed shocked about our 6 pm arrival, and ""sanitized"" a large table for us quickly. Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders. 

We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it ""was good.""  The prices for drinks weren't that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers). 

We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter. 

All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. ""no beans"" ""light on the cheese"") were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience. 

What a way to wrap up a review..

El Arado has gotten a bad wrap - but, the staff is decent, the food wasn't too shabby and the drink prices are cheap. A good place to start out for affordable and filling eats before a night out in Fountain Square (or to strip clubs).",2010-01-09 21:29:40,El Arado Mexican Grill,1063 Virginia Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46203,39.7523127,-86.140383,3.0,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

2023,2453,uqlhve-HegmDcUURZhZPVA,skN2XhKXlcjf53uIwzAedw,4,"It's Memorial Day. What better food than a burger?! We're out of town and didn't know what was available (other than the typical fast food joints and Five Guys). We narrowed our search to Burger Up and Cheeseburger Charley's. We settled on Burger Up and boy am I glad.

I'm a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately, all too many places really mess-up a hamburger (Five Guys included). We read some reviews here on yelp and still couldn't be certain we were making the right decision. Someone complained about ""family style seating"" (sitting with strangers) and another mentioned a ""dorked-up"" PB&J.

First, let me say that the decor was quite unique. There were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and I'm certain you could tell the hostess that wouldn't be preferable. Honestly, though, life's short. Chill-out and make the best of it. Are you really that unsociable?! The menu plainly states that it's grilled. Who's ever eaten a grilled PB&J?! If that's not what you're looking for, don't order it.

Finally, for the burgers...

I ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied. Someone complained that it was dry. You must have gone on an ""off"" night, because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty. The server told us that we could opt for Heinz ketchup, if we didn't like their house ketchup, but who wouldn't like their house ketchup? Good stuff. You also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. We didn't get regular fries, but their sweet potato fries were great, too!

Okay, so no restaurant is perfect. Our server, Daniel, was great. Ambiance and food was great. The sweat tea was not good, nor was the lemonade.

There you have it. What they are known for -- burgers -- were definitely worth it. I think someone complained about the cost. We spent $35.00 for two, but where do you not spend that much for two (including a tip).

As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.

The food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.

Bottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory.

I absolutely love BBQ and southern food. With that said my family and I decide to try this place for take out since it was brand new. First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. 

Never the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had.

I don't live in Tucson but my girlfriend does and I only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when I do make it up to Tucson. Wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked Maynards. 

Arriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasn't the restaurants fault as downtown Tucson is undergoing some major improvements. Once we got inside the hostess was nice. We sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us. 

We both were really excited and hungry for a good meal, the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard, the service was not the best, our waiter was slow and didn't seem very busy even though it was Friday night. 

I ordered ""The Burger"" and my girlfriend had the Filet Mignon. The food made it out decently timed, but I was unhappy when I took a bite into my burger I ordered it Medium and it was burnt to the crisp, way past over done and had no color, just burnt black. For a 20 dollar burger it was not what I expected had no flavor what-so-ever. But the bacon I bought for an extra 2.00 on the burger was really good so that's a positive. 

Now for the positives, the Bacon was really good, the size of the burger was perfect. And the French fries on the side were amazing. 

My girlfriend loved her steak and I took a bite and it was really good so I was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well.

Overall it wasn't that bad of an experience and I would dine there again, my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good, might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasn't feeling on his burger game that night.

By far the worst pizza I've had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don't order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi's, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn't gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late.

If you're looking for quality meal that is quick and affordable, the Fountain has you covered. The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  

Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.

I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.

For my side, I chose their ""spicy carrots"" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.

Our food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.",2015-03-19 04:54:53,The Fountain On Locust,3037 Locust St,Saint Louis,MO,63103,38.636198412,-90.2230380318,4.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

It was a little tricky to find and I may or may not have ran a stop sign or two as I looked for it.  oopsies! :)  We finally made it inside after my scary driving.  The place is so stinkin' cute.  I love the decorations, the old decor, and the little booths with the radio thing.  

The menu is slightly overwhelming if you're looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good!  After debating for what felt like an hour I finally settled on the Thin Mint martini and boy was it good - a tad strong but YUMTASTIC in my mouth!  

Stewart got the Chocolate Covered Almond which also tasted fabulous and the Orange Dreamsicle which I didn't care for.  Then again I don't like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one. haha.

Kate got The Great Mississippi Mudslide which was amazing as well and the Love Potion #9.  The love potion one tasted interesting - kinda like a liquid PB&J in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for.

I'd definitely come back and visit again with friends since it was a cute little place and I'd love to try the others I was debating on.   

Funny thing though - I was totally the only one carded! of course I do look like I'm 15 so what can ya expect?! I thought it was funny.

We were at Chaifetz Arena for a concert on Saturday night and were hoping to find somewhere to eat in walking distance so that we didn't have to drive and hunt. It was 11pm so the first place we tried had already closed their kitchen. We then decided to try The Fountain. We were pleasantly surprised to be cheerily welcomed in and told the kitchen was open. And not only was the kitchen open but the menu options were great! As a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find multiple options. I went with a veggie hummus sandwich on a unique and delicious bread. They had several unique and healthy side options as well. After a fairly healthy meal, we decided we could treat ourselves to the chocolate banana malt and it was fantastic! I am very glad we found the Fountain!

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   I ordered a ""u pick 2"" soup and sandwich.  Dill pickle potato soup, which was exactly like it sounds....delicious!  And the Blackhawk sandwich came on a soft fluffy Vienna roll with rare roast beef, roasted red pepper, lettuce, tomato, and a goat cheese spread.  I could have used a touch more of the goat cheese, but, for less than $8, it was a great lunch.  Oh, yeah....there was a side of Billy Goat chips too  =)

The reason I didn't give The Fountain a 5 star rating was my dessert.  I ordered the Johnny Rabbit Monkey Malt: a chocolate malt blended with bananas.  I am a malted freak, and was  a little disappointed when it came out...not very thick, and not very malty.

The coconut ice cream I have had in the past has tasted more like vanilla ice cream with coconut flavoring; this was not the case here.

The whipped cream was dense and delicious, and along with the hot fudge, this place put forth one of the best ice cream experiences to date.

I love this place but don't make it downtown too often. This is usually my go-to place before an event at TCC. Unfortunately, I think it's everyone else's go-to place, and it can get very crowded. You order Chipotle-style, tell them what you want and what you want on it. They make it right there in front of you, and you grab it and sit down. There are complimentary chips and a decent salsa bar. Getting a table is the tricky part. When it's busy, you have to vulture it and immediately grab people's seats when they leave.

They have great happy hour specials. I believe nachos are $2 off, and you can get 5 tacos for $10. I've heard the tacos are good, but I just can't bring myself to get anything besides nachos. They are excellent. They have a decent tap selection, but the margaritas are amazing so I usually get one of those. The mangoyita is so good! I am not a big drinker, but I can suck one of those down in no time at all. If you like chile mangoes, you can't pass it up!

Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.

We ordered two tacos each, with the beans/rice/drink combo as well. We probably should have split one of the combo plates as the walk home was a bit more of a waddle. The fish tacos were decent, but I've had better.

The fish itself didn't have much flavor so most of the taco's taste came from the toppings. I'd try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!

The presentation was impressive and amazing. Everyone got surprised by the portion of their food. The brisket was tender but didn't have too much flavour. The potato in the salad was not cooked enough and still very hard and raw. The yam fries was the highlight of the dinner. The sloppy Hogg burger was too big to have everything with one bite. Even the burger lover had to either cut it into half or dissemble it. The pork meat was thick cut but dry and flavourless. The pineapple was also thick cut and grilled.

Hendel's is that special kind of place.

When a coworker convinced me to eat there for lunch, I thought, ""Where the hell are you taking me?!"" as he turned off Lindbergh onto some seemingly random local roads.  I found myself in an area untouched by the familiar quazi-ghetto strip malls that I felt personified Florissant.

Eating outside is a huge recommendation on the patio with the well tended garden and the overall cozy feel of the place.  The service is friendly and the food is very good, but nothing spectacular.

Moving on...Parking in the area is a challenge small streets don't help either. I understand it is something out of there control but when developing a restaurant your seating calculator is based on parking spots available. This will let you use areas more productively and efficiently. Also it is very confusing where the front door is or where guests are to come in. The signs in the back just make things more confusing. We would have enjoyed sitting outside the weather was not too bad but with properly placed fire pits you could take advantage of all your patio seating.
On to the menu, limited but great because of the size of the establishment and very well priced. The selections were good and diverse which is key to satisfying a variety of palettes but...if you offer small a menu everything that comes out should be perfectly cooked and should taste as good as it looks. I had the pork chop unfortunately it was cooked to a med rare. I do like my pork medium but rare is wrong. My wife had the salmon which looked slightly overcooked but she was fine with it. My friend had the bone in rib eye which was cooked well but as far as taste you can tell it was choice grade and lacked a beefy flavor many look for when ordering that cut. His wife had the tilapia and she did not eat it at all! The breading was soggy and tasteless and was non-visually appealing. Too many bland colors on the menu plate presentation is everything! If it looks good it taste good! 
Also we noticed the menu doesn't offer a description of your sides which this technique is usually used in ala carte menus. I am sure your mashed potatoes are a staple to your menu, but it's important for your chef to check potatoes often through the night because they will brown and become gummy if not maintained right as mine were no good. All of us who received the side of vegi's we received cold and very wilted and over cooked. 
The last item is we never saw a managers presence we had a food issue and no one came to our table to follow up with us. There was also a table that had children running and screaming which causes safety issues for your staff and the children. If the food runner's were taking food and one of the kids tripped or ran into the runner and hot food were to fall on them or one of the guests it would have been serious.",2012-10-08 21:18:25,Hendel's,599 Rue St Denis St,Florissant,MO,63031,38.7952860404,-90.3255335,4.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

Pretty standard as far as hotel beach resorts go -clean rooms, fairly large (2 queen beds and a couch/sitting area). A restaurant downstairs that serves lunch and dinner buffets (but it wasn't that good, didn't even soak up my alcohol!) and of course the shop where you can buy way overpriced flip-flops if you forgot yours.

Now for the Tiki Bar: large, actually two bars plus a stage area. Overlooks the bay and boats can anchor up here and enjoy the small beach front or walk up and have a tiki-drink. I can't say anything special about the drinks- they weren't specially strong and even for the holiday there was no ""special"" drink (like how about a ""memorial mai tai""?) 
Although there were a good many people there you could still walk around, dance if the notion grabbed you and *bonus* they had misters so it didn't feel too hot (not good for my lobster-lookin' body right now though!).

Make sure you get there early to find some good parking.

The drinks were made well - packed a punch and although the waitress had a bit of an attitude, we did feel a little bad for her with so many party animals around. The drinks had plenty of alcohol, although they were average to expensive in pricing. I would probably pre-game before heading to Shepards. I saw at least 4 people pass out from drinking during our visit. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door which is perfect walking distance from Shepards.

Tucked away in a strip shopping center, albeit a cute shopping center, is this little non descript  restaurant. Since it was early in the day, we really weren't worried about a reservation although I did call as a just in case measure.

We wanted to sit outside since the back looks so pretty but were told it was closed but were led instead to an enclosed patio. Still nice. 

Nicer still was when our server brought us bread, olive oil and a plate of marinated cannelloni beans with yellow and green squash. Wow! The squash were just a tad bland and needed salt but the beans were really flavorful.

My husband ordered the squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella cheese and I the beef carpaccio. Although I did miss capers on the beef and there was too much salad, both the dishes were really good.

Now, our server gave us the list of specials and mentioned that two of them were served with langostines. I had seen these on one of the cooking shows but didn't know exactly what they were. My husband ordered the Carbonarra and I got the Langostines with a blush sauce served with lump crab and fresh tomato.

My dish was pricey, yes it was but incredibly worth it. Imagine a cross between a lobster, a shrimp and butter. Really. The langostines simply melt in your mouth leaving happiness behind. The carbonarra with panchetta instead of bacon my husband ordered is the best I've ever ordered or even tried to make. 

As I've said, we were really early so we got to watch the prep of the restaurant between the the lunch and the dinner service. It was truly a privilege. These servers went through the place with precision, dusting, wiping, washing and primping every aspect of the restaurant.

We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail), the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant).

I had the fish and chips.  The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.

My wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.

Fortunately though, their lunch is delicious! I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! 

Sad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!

The patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable. She even brought my mum

The french toast was delicious! It almost reminded me of the bread pudding. The only problem... it wasn't big enough!!! If I wasn't being conservative I could have eaten that portion of french toast in 2 bites. Not joking. It was good but not sure if it was worth like $7. The roast beef sandwich however was AMAZING! Boar's head never gets old. There was also some kind of chutney in the sandwich which is what made it pretty tasty in my opinion. And the sandwich was only like $6 and came with fruit.

The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  

Prices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.

One last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).

After trying out many sushi restaurants in Nashville, i have finally found my favourite place for sushi! Their menu is 90% sushi and the other 10% is miso soup, gyzoa and various salads, no bento boxes, udon, donburi etc. Place is old and out dated but didnt bother me because it reminded me of most jap restaurants at home, my partner however noticed a unusual scent and the fact that they needed to renovate the place a little. We had the gyoza has a starter and it was delicious! My partner had the California, rock & roll and crunch shrimp roll. 
I had spicy tuna(raw), spicy crab and crab with fried shrimp roll. I was reluctant to try the more tradtional sushi or nigiri as i have been let down so so so many times so i decided to order rolls that i wouldnt regret so much later on lol 
 Everything was amazing!! Couldnt believe how great every roll tasted. My fave was the spicy tuna roll, it was fresh and how it should be made. Our waiter was nice and attentive.

We had the Dr. Dave roll, the Choo Choo roll, and a roll our waitress recommended that was topped with mango.  All three were delicious!  The Choo Choo roll is topped with strawberries which added an extra dimension to the flavor of the roll I haven't experienced before.  The size of the place is small, be prepared to wait.  We got lucky because it was Fall break at Vanderbilt so we got in right away.

The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu.

I think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn't like cajun seafood, you know they're not the one!

My advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.

The bbq sauce is pretty good but not great. 
The Mac & Cheese tasted ok but the noodles were way overcooked. It'd be much better if it were baked and had a little crustiness to it.

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch. I'd say they both definitely had fresh ingredients, and definitely tasted fresh, but I think the balance of flavors wasn't quite right for the slammin' salmon. Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu. 

Overall, you pay a high premium for a gimmicky meal.

I work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.

A couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?

Today I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, ""So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?"" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review, but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment.

NOM NOMS
Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow.

I did my research on places downtown offering happy hour specials and based on what's advertised I picked Tryst for a gathering of 4. 
We were seated promptly outside. The location and the view are excellent! The outside decor is cozy and elegant. I asked the hostess what the happy hour specials were and she told me they don't have any. I asked our waitress the same question, and she pointed to the section of the menu that lists the offerings. The happy hour specials before 7 pm are half off house wine, some beers, well liquor and appetizer specials. We took advantage of the half off house wine- excellent malbec! The problem was with the appetizers. There weren't any. The menu clearly states -half off appetizer specials.  We were told that they are in the process of changing the menu and currently there are no appetizer specials. My personal belief is that if something is offered, especially in writing, it should be honored and delivered. Oh, well...
The food- it was very good! I'm not a fan of calamari, and I would never order them. After tasting my friend's calamari I did put in my own order. They were that good- tender and juicy! The serving was very much on the small side.

I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry/Cake/Sweets stuff kind of place. ""BITTERSWEET confections"" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of ""THE SPOTS"", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets. I was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts I've been having these kids are in for a real TREAT!!

Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.
An early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. 
Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected ""spicy"" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.

Food = disappointingly lacking in flavor and quality.  We ate at the lunch buffet on a Saturday, if it were priced $4.99 instead of $8 I might be less inclined to complain, but it was entirely unexceptional.
I have eaten at many different Indian restaraunts in 5+ countries and multiple cities (most recently Monterey, California where Ambrosia is by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had) and Shere Punjab is one of the worst Indian food restaurants to which I have been.

The naan bread is thin and flavorless, vegetable dishes are significantly lacking in the expected robust flavors and spices, the texture of things (for instance the Saag (spinach dish) seemed as though it came from a can. Blended like baby food. Not a lot of selection.
There were no labels on the food at the buffet.

To say the least, this place did not satisfy my craving (nor my fiance's) for good Indian food and we will not be back.

We were not disappointed. We started of with their pork & shrimp dumplings. They looked more like Shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious. They have 4 spice levels; mild, medium, hot, & Thai hot. They are not kidding around with how spicy their food is. Normally I order the Pad Thai the first time I visit a Thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier Garlic Beef at their medium spice level. It was delicious & perfectly spicy. The hubby got the Panang curry chicken, medium spice, & it was delicious & perfectly spiced too. The portion sizes were just right. We finished off our meal with their sweet, sticky rice with mango. OMG, it was the best I've ever had! They use the black rice & it was warm & drizzled with hot sweetened, condensed milk. The mango was perfectly ripe & there was more than 2-3 slices. We will definitely go back. The hubby wants to try something hot.

friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. 

hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. 

our server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  

At the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. 

perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",2013-09-04 03:14:34,Miller's Ale House - Springfield,18 Baltimore Pike,Springfield,PA,19064,39.924929,-75.3123829,3.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1
2282,2823,9QouEVrRdV_6Aa_C5lAUGg,vFpbUcVAXxrSz5mFIzKbyw,1,"first off the service is absolutely terrible. the waiter only came over to take our order and bring us our drinks and food. after that when we needed something we practically had to look around to hunt him down during our entire meal. he never bothered to come over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills or how our food was. even when we wanted our check he was no where to be found. 
as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. 
when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. 
when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. 
i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)

This place is a bar first and foremost: its selection of innovative cocktails spans pages upon pages whereas their food offerings span two. So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.

But: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.

I landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.

(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)

The space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The ""kitchen"" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.

Oh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? 

So: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.

So... to the eats.

1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?

2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.

The rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.

Anyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon. It was absolutely perfect. Mmmm, Seelbach.",2012-11-07 18:42:03,The Libertine Liquor Bar,38 E Washington St,Indianapolis,IN,46204,39.7672488945,-86.1567753553,4.0,0,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,0

Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.

We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece ""jumbo"" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says ""here's your food."" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.
***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.
I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.
We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.
I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.

I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone ""youguysdoingalright?okaycool."" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.

Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!

2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.
1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.",2014-03-15 18:07:44,Joe Bob's Chicken Palace,7689 S Virginia St,Reno,NV,89511,39.4564348,-119.7817824,3.5,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

I always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu ""not fried"") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.

The service was outstanding and the food I'd say was some of the best in New Orleans. Even the freshly made bread was piping hot and delicious. We started with the oysters good enough, which were four fried oysters with bearnaise sauce and Benton's bacon- a must get. Then we both got scallops and swine with a butternut squash pur√©e and balsamic vinegar. All of the entrees sounded phenomenal, but we both couldn't resist getting that dish. The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

My girlfriend and I went on a Wednesday night for Restaurant week and didn't know what to expect but we were overly satisfied. We ordered blood orange margaritas and they were strong and delicious. For our appetizers we had meatballs and let me tell you they weren't your average meatballs. They were veal and beef meatballs that melted in your mouth. Our other appetizer was some sort of grilled cheese that was amazing as well. For our entree we had the fishermen stew that was full of flavor and well balanced. Initially I did not think I was going to like it but it was to die for. Every element of the stew had it's own flavor and it was properly cooked. My girlfriend ordered the steak that came with cauliflower puree and a vegetable medley that was delicious as well. This was the first time we had ever ordered our steak to be medium-well and ever since we've been hooked. The steak was so juicy, tender and seasoned so eloquently and the puree was seasoned beautifully as well. 
The service there was amazing!! I forget the waitors name but he was great with the menu. He helped us order and came back frequently to check on us.

I wasn't overly impressed with the cocktail choices, I've been so spoiled lately from the vast collection of craft cocktails around town, so I just stuck to water. 

As I generally do drag my meet-up group with me, we had a table of 14 and this poor kid had to take care of all of us by himself. He got a little help when the main dishes came out, but other than that he was on his own. They even seated another table in his section. They knew we were coming, so I would say understaffed. Our waiter tried his hardest and he ran all night, but service could have been better had he gotten a bit more help or at least not be seated more tables. 

Anyway, let's get to the food. We often share dishes, so I had quite a few samples and here is my verdict:

Beer cheese tater tots: absolutely delicious, big portion, must have for any tater, cheese and/or bacon fan.. it hits all those areas.

Fried cauliflower: fantastic dish, also quite a portion, delicately breaded cauliflower fried to a crisp, tender but not mushy inside and served with an interesting ranch sauce.

Fried avocado: I was suspicious I must admit, but it turned out nice... not as big a portion as the other dishes, but nicely done. Coated avocados, deep fried, nice outer crunch, creamy middle, served with a grilled lime and a special ranch sauce... trickle some lime juice on the avocado and dip it in the ranch... omg good.

Shishito peppers: guess that's the new fad...basically roasted peppers... not as exciting as it may sound. The little sesame dip that came with it brought  most of the flavor for this dish. Lots of peppers though. 

Chilaquilles: seemed to be a nacho type creation with lots of chicken and cheese. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my for this dish, somewhat bland. big portion though.

French Fries: not worth it

Tater Tots: absolutely delicious

Onion rings: meh

Cucumber tomato salad: wonderful, large portion, nice vinaigrette, not overpowering, wonderfully light fresh salad. highly recommend giving it a try. 

Mac and cheese: good stuff

Doctorate burger: overrated and deemed not worthy of the price tag.

Double Major: good, but in my opinion was overdone and a bit dry.

French burger: a very drippy cheesy affair, nicely done though.

Overall I would say it's an ok burger spot. On the pricey side, but good for an occasional outing. I probably would just eat all the apps and sides because they were well worth it.",2017-10-25 18:14:29,Burger Study,28 W Georgia St,Indianapolis,IN,46225,39.7643833,-86.1588649,4.0,0,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,0

I'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.

I guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.

As far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. 

The best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. 
The Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.
There's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.

There are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session.

The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.

Given that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.

We split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.

Since both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable. 

All in all, service was meh, but the brunch food 100% overshadows any issue we had with the service. A warning, though, the brunch menu is not very extensive. The choices, however, are very diverse in flavour and taste. Do not pass up this gem.",2015-05-27 19:28:45,The Blue Duck,2859 Holme Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19152,40.0571673033,-75.0304835714,4.0,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

The mac and cheese is amazing. The cheese it uses is great and the dish comes out sizzling hot. Once I started eating it, I could not stop till I finished it. I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and ""Banh mi"" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.

Of course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.

It's a small place, so any table you get is a good one. This is one of the few places on Frenchman Street that seems okay for children: mine are 9 and 11 and very capable of behaving well in a gastropub setting. The menu has a great baked mac & cheese and the waitresses are warm and welcoming. I have to say, after sampling the fish tacos, I sorta wish that I had ordered the mac & cheese, too! The tacos were okay but small and pretty bland. The mac & cheese was plentiful and well-seasoned. But this place is all about the music and the drinks, and on these they won me over. Had a simple Stella Artois apple cider (despite the great drink selection) and hubby enjoyed his porter. If you make a reservation, they give you 90 minutes to dine, which to me was more than enough.

The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The service however was terrible. Since everything is served tapas style the food comes out as it's ready. Unfortunately my tacos took so long that everyone was finished eating and I still didn't have my food. 

Then I saw the table next to me (which arrived 30 min after us) served not one but two taco plates. When I asked the server what's going on, she gave me a really bitchy attitude and acted as though she was talking to a child. She goes ""yeah like I said the kitchen is backed up."" To which I said yes but not enough She did take them off the bill but her attitude was so off putting and condescending I didn't even care at that point.

Most things were really good- we were starving though and waited over an hour to get seated.  The meat and cheese plate stands out.  I'm a sucker for cheese.  Other notable menu items are:  fried pickles (actually, they were amazing), french fries (sooo good), the lamb sliders weren't that good in my opinion, but the masses seem to like them (read in other reviews).  Something with mustard sauce, maybe egg rolls, or shrimp tempura were good- obviously, the condiment was the one that stood out to me.  That boolgogi bowl was really good too.

I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.

When we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?

Anyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:

-Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.

-Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.

-Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.

-Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.

-Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.

-Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.

-Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback. 

-Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.

-Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.

2403,3009,sVMZ9sgBqM7yEgOh2-OUZA,w0lcP2ngFaUpBGi5yzlYDw,2,"Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. 

When I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.

Now, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.

The staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.

The ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.

The food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. 

The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.

Obviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.",2016-01-04 05:53:55,Yah Mon,"301 W Platt St, Unit C",Tampa,FL,33606,27.9422145,-82.4629632,4.5,1,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,1

We started with the beef empanadas and chicken empanadas which were some of the best I have ever had. We also got the cheese bread which was delectable and so soft and moist. For my entree, I got their sampler plate which came with the chicken curry, which was out of this world tender and very tasty, the jerk chicken, which was way to spicy for my liking, and the brown stew which was also very good. Other than the spiciness of the jerk chick, which is how it is supposed to be, I have nothing I could even think to complain about this place.

They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume.

For dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.

We came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent, juicy, the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.

Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute, new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews. 

Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".

This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations, no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood, which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table, my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".

We got there, were told there was a little bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.

We both got the filet, done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say, possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry, Dad). 

Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere, the staff, the decor, the food, hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will.

I tried to make a Sunday brunch reservation before the flower show for 10 people and was told I needed to speak with some one in the events office( not sure when a party of ten became an event).
I was told to book this i would need a preset menu and a deposit. Who does this?

However, when I got there and took a look around I saw the chicken and waffles and decided it wasn't for me (you only get half a waffle and the chicken looked dry.. maybe I am jaded by Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles). After a night of gorging on cheesesteaks I decided to go light and ordered the bagel with lox and honey nut cherrios. The cherrios were served with fresh fruit and the presentation of both my dished were nice. My girlfriends ordered a spinach omelet,  huevos ranchero, tater tots and mac and cheese. The macaroni and cheese was to die for.. baked  thick and topped with bread crumbs. The portions were good sizes and they had fun cocktails (make your own bloody marys).

I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was quite good. However we felt that the service was definitely lacking. Everyone was very nice but our waitress was MIA most of the time. I asked for a re-fill on my water and that took like 10-15 minutes only after I asked again did I get it. It wasn't just that though, that actually wasn't even that big of deal to me. SHe checked on us once and then disappeared the rest of the time. When we had finished eating  she was no where to be found. We literally sat there with our finished plates for about 15 minutes and i would attribute it to being busy but it wasn't even busy because at that point we were literally the only ones in the section we were in, and there was only a handful of people in the restaurant itself. We had to call over a staff member to get our waitress  and they ended up just getting our check for us and making up some lame excuse about our server doing some type of stock in the basement. If that was really the case though why didn't anyone else cover her table? It was obvious that we were finished for some time and looking around for our waitress and like 4 different staff members walked by our table at least 5 times.

The menu is a good size, lots of options for people  but not so much as to make me concerned for the amount of ingredients that need to be stocked. Perfect for a weekend brunch.

The secret here is the staff. Our server was one of the best I have ever had. She was friendly and efficient, making great suggestions (pickle juice in a Bloody Mary? Awesome!), keeping our coffees refilled, and keeping us updated on the status of our drink and food orders. Everything came out perfectly and pretty quickly. 

Our food was excellent, and serving gravy on the side for chicken and waffles is a fantastic idea. The heuvos rancheros were nice and light, and our request for sriracha was gladly met.

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?

Now, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.

If you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.

Because we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long).

On this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... 

I ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.

Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.

The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.

He'd say something foolish, she'd dump a plate of fettucini alfredo over his head and storm out of the caboose in which they dined, leaving him there in his sad little bow tie.

I didn't even realize that there are dozens of Spaghetti Factories throughout the United States until I lived in LA for a while.  Before that, I just assumed it was a quaint little locally-owned Italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Nashville.  It certainly seems too novel to be a chain, but that's just part of its charm.  The Spaghetti Factory is the perfect place to dine if you're on a date or celebrating a special occasion.  It's classier than most places but not over the top, and they serve all the traditional Italian items you'd expect (every pasta imaginable).

Perhaps the most unique aspect of the Spaghetti Factory (and what made me like it when I was a youngster) is its decor.  They have an old train car in which you can dine, dozens of chandeliers and ornate furniture all over the place.  It's like dining in a Victorian lady's parlor...or something.

The food itself is quite good as well (almost as neat as the atmosphere).  Plus, they have spumoni!  I love that crazy Italian ice cream.  The servers tend to be pretty quick and helpful.  The only problem with Spaghetti Factory is that it is Ground Zero for tourists.  It's as if every joker in a fanny pack seeing the sites on Broad and Second Avenue assumes he is the first guy to discover this neat little Italian spot.

Let's just say we used to eat for less than $15 for two and leave it at that. We were downtown for the Nashville Hot Wings Festival which was sort of a disappointment. We purchased the all you can eat wristband - so the fact that we were at the Old Spaghetti Factory should give you a clue as to how well the festival went. Drinks at the bar - 30 minute wait - expected - so no big deal. I have always ordered the potpourri - a selection of four of their mainstay sauces. Getting excited as is see dishes come to tables nearby with the manager's special (two sauce selections) with huge portions of each. I get mine and it's like...wait...what!? Miniscule servings of each of the four sauces. I feel cheated. Don't get me wrong - the flavor was there, but in comparison to neighboring tables as well as others at our table - I got screwed.

If you let them know - you can embarrass a party member that has a birthday, because they ask whoever is in earshot to sing happy birthday to them. Amber was the center of attention in our area. What's funny is that I ran into her on the street a little later and walked up to her and said, ""Amber! How are you? It's been awhile"" She gets this deer in the headlights look trying to remember where she knew me from. ""I'm just messing with you - we were just inside and sang happy birthday to you.""

The inside layout has changed a little since our last visit. What was once the foyer has been transformed into a private dining area for a large group. What was once a waiting area has been made into additional dining space. We sort of miss the Victorian couches and such. The hostess station is now in the area that used to be basically open to the sidewalk. Over the years we have sat in different sections of the restaurant including the trolley car. Think we enjoyed the section facing the river most of all. This trip we were right in the main traffic flow of people coming and going so atmosphere suffered. Also one of the waiters close by must have previously worked for Dick's Last Resort and was probably fired for being too obnoxious - loud - too loud for this place.

I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.",2017-02-09 14:59:25,NY Pizza Grill,4337 W Kennedy Blvd,Tampa,FL,33609,27.944940567,-82.5168151855,1.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Eggs looked and tasted like they had been held for a while after being cooked, not at all fresh. Salad on one plate had more dressing then salad, really inedible. What I did notice was the complete lack of bacon or sausage or anything pork related. Odd for a brunch, but maybe gypsies don't eat meat?
The other thing I found was 1. It was 40 degrees in the bathroom, really really cold. 2. The wall next to our table really needed painting, or at least washing, food splatters and grease stains on the paint were really unappealing. The cute puffy wall coverings looked like someone used them as napkins over and over.  A tremendous disappointment after many really great experiences at Southern Cross. 
It seems to me they can do a lot better, or close the place for a rehab. 
We felt pretty ripped off with brunch, though the live music was awesome. Maybe dinner is better, breakfast is really hard to do well after all but I doubt we will ever find out as we have no intention of returning.

Slightly overwhelming to say the least, meats and cheeses (at the time) I had never even heard of. With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. 

Fast forward a few years... 

My most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. 

I decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!

For pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge!

We ordered two medium speciality pizzas and get our bill: Two large pizzas at $22.45 and $20.15, minus $1.42 for each pizza....How exactly am I upgrading for 2.00 and saving any money? Basically they charged you for the price of the large and subtracted $1.42 (why, I still don't know).

Combos (depending what you get): $4.95-$6.65

The parking lot is pretty small and from what we gathered, is always packed.  Droves of people coming in and out, most looking like pros who have been doing this for decades. 

Upon walking in the market, nobody greets you, and nobody seems to care you're there.  Why you ask?  Because it's an old Italian market that lets their goods do the talking.  The front room are where the meats live, but that's not what we were after.  

Give me the sandwiches...

It was a good thing I decided to check out the menu online because once you go back and to the left it gets real - fast.  You pick your deli number (something so foreign to this Atlanta girl, but seems like it's a must here in Florida) and wait for the chaos to begin.  They take orders faster than you would imagine and before you can say ""Forgettaboutit"" you're up.  Slightly panicked at the fast pace of it all I promptly ordered 5 sandwiches (please feel free to judge me).  

While we waited for our babies to arrive we perused the prepared food section and decided on a fennel salad and chicken pasta.

In less than 10 minutes our sandwich babies were born (no really, they were so heavy, it was awesome!).  We also grabbed a fresh loaf of bread on the way to check out (please  grab yourself one, you can thank me later).

They gave us our sandwiches in a shopping basket and when my friend asked the cashier where he could put it, she said fairly dryly ""Where you got it""

We didn't even mind.  We were just here for the sandwiches.

Out of all of the sandwiches, 3 were meh, but two standouts were the Hot Italian and the Boars Head BLT.  The magical bread that the BLT is on makes the sandwich a homerun.  it's big, messy, and delicious.  The fennel salad was not very good IMO, and the chicken pasta was just okay.

They don't say, ""for here or to go"" so they can heat up the food for you, they don't have a clear spot at any of the counters for customers to go up to without having to push their way through a series of people who might have already ordered, could be waiting to order, or are trying to figure out what to order, there's no way to tell one crowd from the other. When you eventually figure it out the first time around and get your food, you might have ordered multiple items, but there's no trays to make sure you can carry all of the food out to the pay station and then to the patio, or bags for to go orders(I'm pretty sure if you asked for one they could get one, but I should not have to ask, especially with my hand in a cast) so you guard yourself against bumps as best you can to hope the food you waited so uncomfortably for doesn't get knocked out of your hands, forget trying to make a single trip for food and drinks, you won't make it. Speaking of their ""coffee bar"" they're always super busy, scrambling around, and I got skipped over while waiting to order my drinks, then it proceeded to take about 8-10 minutes to get my drinks and pay for them, all whilst growing ever more hungry with each passing minute. The pizza looked really good, especially the ""chicken and vodka"" pizza, but it wasn't very flavorful and it's all extremely messy to eat. The patio space is very limited, so you might have to wait to get a seat, or have a seat taken while you go inside for the necessary second trip. The mist fans are a good concept, but it does nothing but agitate me further as I try to keep napkins on the table, the parchment paper from under certain foods,such as pizza and pastries, from flying away or up in the way as we ate, and keeping my hair out of my face and food as the water droplets blow directly on everything. Being in a group with a friend in a wheelchair was difficult, we had to somehow clear a space through the mass of indifferent people packed into the store from the front door to the back, with too few handicap spaces having to park in the rear of the parking lot. As a disabled veteran myself, the overwhelming environment made me uneasy, and the invasion of my personal space made me anxious and extremely uncomfortable. Add this to the inaccessibility of the entrance and exit due to the sheer volume of people going in and out of the limited doors and the maze of a parking lot through which my handicapped friend had to go through as cars pulled in and out without regard for their surroundings, and it is a logistical nightmare. I will not be returning despite my group's general enjoyment of the food and their continuing patronage. The systems in place to get the food they enjoy(mostly the pastries) are frustrating to them but they can overlook it. I cannot.",2014-06-28 19:21:34,Mazzaro's Italian Market,2909 22nd Ave N,Saint Petersburg,FL,33713,27.7922562,-82.673539,4.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

Aside from serving up tasty food, Mazzaro's also offers wine tasting events and wine consultations.

Every time my bf and I go to Mazzaro's, which recently has been averaging once a week, we like to sit at the coffee bar and order ourselves each a double espresso con panna and almost always the Sesame Tuna Wasabi sandwich and the Grilled Portobello. We've tried a few other sandwiches but always find ourselves craving for these 2.

Here's how to proceed at Mazzaro's if you want to eat there: Check out all different things Mazzaro's has to offer, then head to the deli and grab a number, look over the menu while waiting for your # to be called, place your order, find a seat at the coffee counter or patio, check back with the deli occasionally to see if your order is ready. Anything you eat at the counter needs to be paid at the counter.

Just try it once. I promise you will be a regular at Mazzaro's.

The St. Louis ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, pepperoni, Italian sausage, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.

The Texas ($7.49) -- Home-made smoky sweet barbeque sauce, red onions, grilled chicken, thick-cut bacon, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses on a flour tortilla.

The Italian ($7.49) --  Parmesan tomato sauce, red onions, red and green peppers, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a tomato-basil tortilla.

The Parma ($7.49) -- Parmesan tomato sauce, grilled chicken, provel and Mozzarella cheeses on a flour tortilla.

The Bleachers 'Chos ($6.99) are really the king! Yea, I know, it's just nachos. But the four-cheese queso is stupendously fabulous, and I could drink it by the gallon!

The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.

The food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building.  I really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it.

Their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too! 

Beware of the long lines though (try to avoid going anytime from 11:45-12:30, if you do, expect a long wait, and no you cannot call ahead and order). If you're a Drexel student, go in between class, guaranteed no line!

When we finally got seated, the waitress was very polite, but forgetful at times. Didnt drink any alcohol or sodas but the lemonade was very tart & the garlic bread was not-so-fresh...had to request for some fresh bread after my family devoured the 1st basket from starving & waiting for so long. I ordered the stuffed shells & chicken parmagiana. The salad was very tasty; however, they only have Italian dressing...no ranch or anything else. I am not a picky eater & rarely complain, but the stuffed shells & parmagiana chicken tasted HORRIBLE!! The chicken was very bland & the stuffed shells were hard & overbaked. The meranera sauce tasted like it was old or aged too long (if there's ever such a thing, lol). I could not bring myself to eat my entree. I had to send it back. I heard the lady at the table next to ours say the salmon was good, so I figured the salmon might be safe. It was actually very good!

There were three hostesses when we arrived. I told one of them that I would like a booth for two. One of the girls made a strange look on her face that was either confused, annoyed or both. I couldn't tell between the two expressions. One of the hostesses takes us to a table. I told her I had asked for a booth and I thought that was where we were going because she didn't acknowledge a booth wasn't available. That's when I figured out why one of the girls made a strange look.

** Just a heads up. Caruso's only takes reservations on large parties. Makes sense. But I still would have liked putting my name down to get a booth **

Shortly after we sat down our server came over and introduced himself. Forgot his name. But he was a decent fellow and was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu.

I went in the establishment craving a cold beer. The beer menu lacked variety. It didn't entice me. Instead I ended up ordering a regular iced tea. The glass was huge, which is always great!

** Keep in mind that it can be a little loud in the restaurant sometimes. **

I ended up ordering The Caruso Special, which consisted of a ton of Italian spaghetti specialties. It was delicious! However, I did not feel like I got enough bang for my buck due to the rather small plate size. I wanted more for the $10.75 I put down for my meal.

 It was a dreary, rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the ""Tennessee Fill Station"" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the ""Tennessee Tap Room"" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the ""Tennessee Brew Works"" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws!

The tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or ""catwalk"" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. 

Biggest fortes:

- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.
- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.
- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.

This coffee is so good that I buy 5#s at a time from Brigitte. It is always fresh and she has even delivered coffee to me while she is under construction of her new place. Personally, I cannot wait until she opens her new location. I never did care much for the Hollander Hotel and I often felt that she was being stifled by the cramped space she worked in. Also, the hotel has a funky smell (sort of like old socks) so I will be glad when she is at her new location and I can sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee without trying to filter out the bad smell from the hotel.

Being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. We chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait. I had the cocktail featuring egg whites, and it was very very tasty (compares well to some similar cocktails I've had at Thunderbird). Once we finally were seated the food was all delicious. The crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing, and reminded me of the flavor of bugles. The skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that, so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops. 
The food and drinks were awesome, and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by.

But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered).

Context:
It was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should ""...forget about your order"" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us... 
What followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. 

Food: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) 
Sweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. 
Pork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. 
Scallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine.
Churros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. 

Service:
Our server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service!

I honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special. My only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite! We will certainly be coming back, and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an Indy restaurant.",2017-08-08 01:14:36,Livery - Indianapolis,720 N College Ave,Indianapolis,IN,46202,39.7766812,-86.1456632,4.5,1,1,,,1,1,0,1,0,0

This time I tried Wei Hong. I told my partner it can't be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going. I was wrong.
The take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.
The steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. 
The beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures.

Both platters came with a tomato and cucumber salad with mint on it that was very tasty. The yellow/saffron rice was also cooked just right. The olives that come with it are interesting. Evidently the owner soaks them in spices and garlic in some type of process. You may or may not like it depending on how much you like the spices present. The platters also come with your choice of appetizer. I've had the hummus twice and both times it was lick your plate good. The pita bread is a little on the dry side but otherwise ok.

On one of the first chilly days of Fall, I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch.

So, I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries; both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from, and honestly, other places to go in the city. However, if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.

Some notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing, but these things are easily amended.

Fries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes, in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).

I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular.

We hung out in the cozy, dark basement lounge, which was pretty great.  From 10-12 on Saturdays (and maybe Thursdays and Fridays as well?) they have a late night happy hour.  The special was $5 house margaritas.  While that may not sound like the most amazing deal to happy hour cheapskates, trust me - it is.  Sauza blanco, hand-squeezed lime juice, and simple syrup made for a tasty drink.  I like when you can actually taste the tequila in a 'rita.

While we weren't here for a full meal, we did try a few of the snacks:

-queso fundido: Delicious melted chihuahua cheese, served with piping hot fresh tortillas, mushrooms, pickled red onions, and peppers. I really loved those red onions.  I could bring home a jar of those.
-the chicharrones: pork rinds served with a dangerously spicy salsa verde.  Again, amazing.

They rarely visit so picking an awesome restaurant- a task assigned to me as the Philly resident- was very important. 

Xochitl did not disappoint. The vibe is understated Old City- totes relaxing, trendy but traditional, doesn't take itself too seriously but your server knows everything about the menu and food and drink is masterfully executed. 

The guacamole was fantastic (if it wasn't, I wouldn't even bother to post a review...) which is a basic requirement for Mexican restaurants. Check. 

Since we were feeling poor that night, my fianc√© and I went with tacos rather than a full-on entree. Fish tacos-can you make them spicy? Um, yeah.  Melt in your mouth. Spicy brisket tacos- also very tasty. There were no leftovers. Our server and bartender colluded to prepare a dessert drink for us, a little shot of tiramisu liqueur goodness. And it was perfect. 

I still can't say the name of this place correctly but I will definitely be back and I would recommend it to others. Mexican food done right is such a treat, and so nice to find in a fun place that has cool staff who can really deliver for a semi special occasion.

This is the old Filo's, I spent many nights there having a few drinks,  listening and dancing to great music by the Worship crew, then walking home. 

We decided to check this place out one Friday night when a friend from out of town was visiting. It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky, yet not too loud, so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular, we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche), I wasn't sure what to expect, it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before, but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido, one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!

They also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday, 10pm-12am.

every dish was excellent, and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche, barbacoa (perfectly cooked), and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.

Our server was super attentive, and very friendly; however I feel like the food was disappointing. Our egg drop soup came out right away at a nice piping hot temperature and when the rest of our food came out it was practically room temperature. 

Feeling adventurous, I had ordered the Shrimp with Candied Walnuts entree with brown rice while he ordered the Sesame Chicken platter. I like the idea of sharing food, but my food was too busy all on its own without adding something else to the mix. The brown rice was cold and very bland while the shrimp was overly sweet and I didn't feel like the candied walnuts and melon balls were complementary flavors.

The chocolate cake we had for dessert was amazing though; 6 layers of chocolate on chocolate. It was so sweet and rich, we ended up sharing a slice.

So to sum up, service was great, dessert was great, but the food needs some work. Sorry PF Changs, I just am not impressed.

We sat at the bar, and was happy to see my tall, attractive, blonde, friendly bartender, who has been there for awhile, ready to serve us.  She was, and always is, quite attentive, cordial and a smooth operator.  

My martini was filled to the brim, a large glass, very easy to get toasted, this is reason enough to go and sit at the bar.

They have a happy hour menu which is quite varied, some selections are large enough to be shared, or small enough to eat a few by yourself.  The happy hour prices I thought reasonable.  Anyway, we started with splitting the dynamite shrimp, flavorful with quite a nice kick to the dish.  4 stars for that dish, about a dozen medium sized crispy shrimp in a nice spicy sauce, a great dish to share.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps, a decent 3 star dish, again large enough to split.  To be kind of healthy I ordered some steamed dumplings, the first serving of dumplings (3 dumplings of each) filled with shrimp, (just OK), the second was pork (good), and the third lemon grass chicken (the best of the bunch).  My friend had the ribs.  He said that they were ""not bad"".

I haven't been there in about six months as I got sucked in to the lively bar scene at Redstone next door.

This review was from about 2 months ago.  Sorry it is a little dated.  Such as life.  

The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   

The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   

Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  

Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   

The combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.  If you have been here, you should try it!",2012-05-28 15:51:39,Redemption,3835 Iberville St,New Orleans,LA,70119,29.9741719,-90.0974353,3.0,0,2,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.

Our waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.

For dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries

What's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. 

We had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.

Redemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.",2013-05-07 13:54:08,Redemption,3835 Iberville St,New Orleans,LA,70119,29.9741719,-90.0974353,3.0,0,2,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

I had the panini Reuben.  Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. 

Salad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.

Presentation was a little sloppy. 

Like every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. 

They have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  

Wait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. 

The second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks. My trip tonight it was about 8 min. For a sat night this is not bad. But not great either. My bartenders were awesome and never left me wanting (except for getting my salad with the main course).

Delivery.
I have attempted (by myself and with friends/family) to have Reginelli's delivered to my house on four separate occasions in the last year.  The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok, so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say, ""We're sorry, we suddenly got really busy, its on its way.""  (This wasn't on a weekend, holiday or Mardi Gras, so go figure about the sudden rush)

...

My pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said, ""We're sorry, we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.""

Had to finally get up from my table and go order a pizza and drinks from the front counter. There are two waitresses and about 5 tables of families. The waitresses are lazy and would rather stand around talking to friends than wait on a table.

The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  

We brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. 

Okay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward.

When everyone of the 16 guests leave happy, restaurant needs to be commended.
Our glasses were constantly refilled, we were being checked on from time to time for our drinks, appetizer and entree- full marks on service. 
I the flip side, The food is brought out as it gets ready and no separate checks are entertained.

For appetizer we got the combination platter with hummus, red pepper hummus and eggplant mash. Also got falafel and saganaki. The falafel was a little underdone and hummus tasted very different from usual. Definitely the cuisine is not authentic Greek but unique adaptation.
 I was satisfied with my blacked Tilapia and DH got lamb chops. On the table, people loved the lamb gyros, lamb kabobs and pesto pasta. The chicken Gyros were very ordinary.
The dessert of bread pudding was stellar though and my cocktail Medusa was nice and sweet although weak.

There was a pleasant belly dancer who kept us entertained.

This hotel fails to get the simple things right and when you fail at that everything else is secondary. 

Customer experience:
Phase two of the customer experience was the beginning of the issues. There was no clear signage to direct you to the valet when we arrived at 10:30 pm which caused me to circle the block to make another pass and find it. 

Phase three the AC system is not adequate at all to cool the room, I set the thermostat to 65 degrees in the living room and the bedroom was still hot and not just for me but my girlfriend as well. The curtains do not block out the sun as they don't close all the way. So instead of a nice long sleep I can't sleep with the heat then the sun bright in early through the window wakes us up. 

At this point I got up to take a shower which is one with the horrible cheap shower curtains that divide halfway up. I got the shower curtain with the one half inside the shower and the other half outside. When I finished the shower the floor was soaked. It's annoying because I specifically took the time to get that stupid cheap shower curtain setup right and it still leaked everywhere. 

Hopefully they will buy real shower curtains, upgrade the AC, and fix the blinds so people can get a good rest but after this night I'm done with Embassy Suites Tampa.

The wifi does not work so don't stay here if you need to get work done unless you use cellular data like I did.

As we were leaving I noticed all the black hold on the wall in the living room area. Pictures attached.",2016-05-31 14:20:08,Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,513 S Florida Ave,Tampa,FL,33602,27.9423153,-82.4547605,2.5,1,2,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

Not too loud at all - conversations were easy and a lot of the patrons were doing just that. There's a jukebox, so maybe it cranks up later in the evening. We were there pretty early. 

Great service from several people working behind the bar. 

Several beers on tap including a local CCCCC IPA, which was solid. Not many wines, though.

Small menu but very good food. The elote (corn) is quite good, as was the cucumber(?) salad. But the brat plate was the star. Wonderful brat, German potato salad, sauerkraut, pretzel and a hot salsa/relish. Best brat plate ever. Served on a cool wood board.

Prohibition is located in or near a somewhat dicey neighborhood, at least to this non-resident's eye. I may very well be wrong about that.

Luscious looking carrots and cocktail onions and green beans came out on an equally verdant and zesty looking bed of fresh lettuce, but after my second bite I realized that looks can be deceiving. Let's just say this app tasted more like a vinegar plate than a pickled veg plate.  The veggie sandwich tasted overly seasoned and a few bites in, I couldn't even finish it.  I almost would have rather they served a Boca Burger and least gotten something somewhat tasty for my money. And then a quarter of the way through our sandwich, a slightly off cook (the head cook?) came out from the kitchen and kept offering the bartenders food, only to be turned down.

We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt.",2017-11-18 23:43:27,The Love,130 S 18th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9506555,-75.1708991,4.0,1,1,,,0,1,0,0,0,0

The chicken had that delicious general tso's sauce coated on each piece, as well as a slight kick at the end. 

I will definitely be ordering from there again. When I called to see if it was possible to veganize an online order, they instructed me to simply write vegan in the comments section.

While the service was spot-on (I don't think my water glass was ever less than 3/4 full), the quality of food just didn't meet my ""steakhouse"" expectations. My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn't anything ""special"" about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland.

My mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.
When you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).
This is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.
We smoked ""sex on the beach"" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)
What I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable.

I ordered the original and was served 6 deep fried balls of goodness. They were tasty, albeit doughy, but left a greasy aching not so fresh feeling. I needed to be drunk to really appreciate the grease. Since it was my first venture I'll say its worth a try, but buyer beware they're super heavy for being small balls of dough. 

The curry chicken I had was a bit disappointing. I scarfed it down thanks to my near state of starvation, but found the roux too rich for my taste.

No but really take a second. Don't be like impatient me who bites into molten takoyaki, disregarding all warnings and good sense! I knew better, but I do these things constantly with pizza slices, and with delicious Japanese street food snacks, evidently.

I am a fan of Maru's savory ping pong-ball-sized pancakes, filled with pickled red ginger, scallions and octopus. Takoyaki, handmade while you wait, eight of them are served up nice and hot... A golden steamin plate of takoyaki, covered in shavings of dried bonito, nori, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce. It's a really great snack, and you know I love a little nosh to share ""on the way"" here or there. I need incentives and rewards for everything. The spicy octopus variety with a little shichimi mayo fits the bill quite nicely.

Also, after peering at the Maru ball cooking process, I am sure that I now really want a nice cast iron takoyaki pan for my very own, to add to my stockpile of kitchen paraphernalia. In addition, just want to note that I love Maru Global's red lanterns with the cute octopus fella on em... My house needs some of those too, because I can't stop hanging decorations from my ceiling.

Went there last Saturday, ordered 2 type of tako balls. Original and BBQ flavor. Both in octopus.. since the real takoyaki supposed to be only using octopus as its' meat. But they have other choices of meat in case you don't eat octopus. Like chicken, beef and such.

1 order of takoyaki consist of 6 balls, cost around $5. Both are very yummy, though I like the original more.

I will definitely go back for more and try on their Yakisoba.

Make sure you put one hour on your parking meter if you order more than just one kind. It took 20 minutes for 2 orders of different flavor takoyaki.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was all-you-can-eat wing Wednesday, but immediately disappointed it only included the breaded boneless wings. I had one serving of 10 at the start of the game -- hot garlic -- and became full because of how thick the breading was. I asked for a side of ranch when ordering, but I never received it. I like my ranch dressing, especially if I'm eating chunks of breading. 

To wash the ""wings"" down, I decided to take advantage of the 99 cent per 10-ounce mug of Bull Brew draft beer, which wasn't anything special but pretty good for a cheap and local beer (USF). 

The service at the bar started out fine. I was asked multiple times if I wanted to order another plate of wings or if I needed another beer. Two hours went by, and when I was finally ready to take advantage of my all-you-can-eat deal, the bartenders were no where to be found. They all seemed busy trying to clean and close -- even though it was still early -- rather than serving their customers. 

After 10 minutes of waiting - and almost missing the 11 p.m. cutoff deadline for the wing deal - I finally got the attention of a bus person and ordered a serving of the honey garlic wings. Instead of getting the serving of 10 I received before, I got six. It could be because I was fuming at how bad of a beating the Gators were getting from the Louisville Cardinals, but my wings were barely warm. And yet again, they forgot to add my side of ranch I made sure to order. 

Maybe I ordered them too late? Or maybe I waited too long to get service? 

Either way, I wasn't thrilled about finishing my second serving of wings. 

At this point I couldn't take it anymore -- the game or the wings -- so I asked for my check. Luckily my beers were cheap, so my bill added up to exactly $20 including tip ($11.99 for the all-you-can-eat wings plus the 99 cent beers). Not a bad price to pay to sit at the bar for almost three hours. 

My experience could have been much better, though. Even if the Gators won.

Upside:  They have great bar food and the best beer selection around.  It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. 

The kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my ""cheers"".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20""+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10"".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  

I still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. 

Luckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks.

Since Friendly's closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). 

Much to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.

After much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn't that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. 

The service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work.

I got the  classic burger and fries.  I'll be honest, it was the worst $11 burger that I've ever had.  Dry and flavorless and made me envy a $2 McDonalds bacon burger flashing on the TV.  The fries were OK.

I usually would not drive so far out of my way for a restaurant, but we came here with some family and I am so glad we did! I'd never been to Dunedin prior to this, and what a cute little place it is! Adorable little downtown area that you'd never expect from such a small town. 

Anywho, Kelly's. When we went, it was jam packed. I believe the wait was 30-45 minutes, so it would certainly behoove you to call ahead and make a reservation. The service was good for how busy it was. Not super quick, but friendly and punctual enough. You can only expect so much when they're packed to the gills. 

The food was phenomenal, and priced pretty fairly for the quality. Perhaps a teensy tiny bit overpriced compared to similar restaurants, but overall can't complain there. I had the seafood pasta and hoooooly cow. Cannot wait to go back for more. It was absolutely decadent, and I'm not even a fan of pasta. If you're already a pasta lover this will knock your socks off. The pasta was so tender and the dish had such a great, deep seafood flavor- not weak or briny at all. My mouth is watering a bit just thinking about it. 

My husband had the baby back ribs and they were devoured in a matter of minutes, so I would guess that means they were good. I can't remember off the top of my head what the other diners had, but I do remember everyone was very, very happy with their meals.

Last weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's, but we paid ~$15 each.

St. Louis is an anomaly. The hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment. Sorry Strange, your toppings are decent, but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick. Sorry Vincent Van Doughnut...actually, I'm not sorry - you should be sorry for selling me that chocolate-coffee abomination. That's the first donut I ever left unfinished. It's literally sprinkled with coffee grounds. It would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that, but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate.

Thankfully, the anomaly works both ways. This homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff, for insanely low prices. Chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheap-donut-chocolate. Blueberry cakes are light, fresh, and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying.

I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... 

The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr√©e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. 

I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  

The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!",2014-02-05 19:40:04,Las Cazuelas Restaurant BYOB,426 W Girard Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19123,39.9698623,-75.1439919,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

3058,3907,CmdRIsHtLEWTBC3Wk0tRpQ,I5KZm-NnxYeEQsmp6nK5_w,0,"I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.

I decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.

I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. 
My husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! 
My favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town.

CI Chu's is great! Cleaner than the one in Westwood. More selection than any of the others I've been to. I love having tofu as an option, even though I'm not a vegetarian. I love the soup and the bread that come as part of the meal. It's never been crowded when I've been there. (By the way, I prefer the one on Broadway to the one on Tanque Verde, service-wise. The food is just as good.)

The only downside is that it is a tad pricey -- I only go when I'm totally starving, since you can't (usually?) take doggy bags.",2009-10-14 21:39:15,C.I. Chu's Mongolian Barbeque,4540 E Broadway Blvd,Tucson,AZ,85711,32.2210111,-110.8955944,3.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

I had the Mushroom and Zucchini pizza and it was alright. The crust was amazing, but I didn't know the pie would have a kick and I truly dislike spicy. Next time I know to tell them no spice and they'll leave it off. I think without the spice the pizza would be great.

UPDATE: I have been to In Riva a few times since writing this original post. Just say don't add spice and the pizza will come out amazing. At least, if you're like me and don't like food spicy.

The ATMS are no surcharge (yes!!!)
They place really, really cool music!

(OK, so I just glanced over at Simon E.'s review of this same WaWa and he says the vibe is upbeat, and that is def. true!  Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)

Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  

Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.

Major points for:  
*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  
*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!
*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.
*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!
*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.

I do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  


For a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  

Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  
Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)

We went for Sunday brunch based upon a best of review in creative loafing. We were told a birthday party just came in so it would be 15 minutes but we could sit. So we did. For about 5 minutes and the waiter 1 came over and took our orders. Bacon and eggs and one of the salad combinations. Waiter 2 brought us a water and coffee after another 20 minutes and said our order was good. About 30 minutes later we got refills.  It was then i commented that the folks beside us to the left had arrived about 15 minutes ago and had just been served  Finally after 1 hour and 15 minutes we got served.

Then when the bill came we were charged $10 for an $8 item and $10 for a $6 item. That took about 10 minutes to correct.

All in all an absolutely MISERABLE experience.  Nothing would make me go back. First time I my life I left a zero tip.  The final nail was when I was trying to get the bill corrected waiter 1 was comping the other table for drinks because of the wait.  I wish I had read the other yelp sunday reviews before going there because they are absolutely correct.

Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.

It is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  

The overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  

The food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  

With the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  

The spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  

If I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.

They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.

While I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous.

My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.

When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

My girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The ""Latin jazz"" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.

We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.

I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.

We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights, but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others.",2010-01-09 23:21:55,Cafe Buenos Aires,1316 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.424829,-119.706032,3.5,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn't be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.

The fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It's very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the ""Hay and Straw"" and loved it. I even had leftovers which is a rare event. The other two dining partners loved their meals as well.

But sadly, that was the best part of our experience.   Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   

As for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.

I got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle.

We split an order of the fried egg rolls + each got a b√°nh m√¨. The soups looked tempting but the bowls were so big! He got another pork belly b√°nh m√¨ and I got the grilled pork. Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.

Afterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.

I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.

Actually, even better than the ""normal"" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy, that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa. 

Oh, speaking of house, they were playing some nice jazzy/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection, or if it was just Pandora. 

Either way, big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.

3253,4185,mZzfH9Rlan0EzIv23uy5Zw,KP5OncF2jhT7_J1phHPPww,6,"This review is based off of one visit as I don't think I will be returning anytime soon. 

I was attending a Christmas get together at Besito with a large group of about 16. I ordered a ""frozen"" margarita. It was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate. It was okay, but a little off for my tastes. It was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving. I only finished about half of it. We ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be $5 instead of the usual $9. We had to ask for the happy hour price, but more on that in a moment. 

Three of us decided to split a queso fundito. This is one of my favorite Mexican Appetizers and I order it regularly at traditional Mexican restaurants. While the queso fundito was still good at Besito, it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version. It is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas. Besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers. It was also served in a very shallow square skillet. When split three ways (and with the 2-3 others in the room that tried it), it left very little queso fundito. The flavor was good. However, with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity, I would not order again. 

I was able to try the chips, salsa and table side guacamole also. I will say that this is probably the best guacamole that I have ever tried. I loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado. The salsa and guac were my favorite things at Besito. However, I can't see myself paying $10 for guac on a return visit. That is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion. 

For my meal, I ordered the Chile Rellenos Con Hongos. I order Rellenos anytime I see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things. Most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side. Let's face it...stuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world. My Rellenos did not come with a side. The came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping $18. I almost didn't order them when I saw the price, but everything else on the menu was that price or higher. The Rellenos had good flavor for the first bite...or maybe two. However, a few bites in I was over it. They are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside. So much freaking goat cheese. I like the stuff, but it was overboard. That wasn't the worst part though, it was the pine nuts. There seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate. I would never order this again. 

Our service was great until it came time for the checks. Our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up. She also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks. However, the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope. When they returned, my card was with my friends check (and had been charged) and my check was missing. WTH? It ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks, get them corrected, get them corrected again and get out of there. My poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since I thought I was almost done when I received the check. Uggg. 

I don't think I will be back to Besito anytime soon. If I do, it will be for happy hour only. It is too rich and not on par enough for this cheap, but picky girl.",2016-12-19 08:45:00,Besito Mexican Restaurant,205 Westshore Plz,Tampa,FL,33609,27.9462497461,-82.5265678062,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

I made the reservation a week in advance and was told it was no problem. We didn't get seated until 9:15. The hostess kept telling us that they were waiting to get tables together, I'm not sure what she meant by that but it was annoying to have 10 people standing around waiting for a table for 45 minutes. 

We waited at the bar and had some margaritas. The first one we tried, the natural one, tasted watered down. The bartender then informed us it had water in it. Who puts water in a margarita? We tried the classic next, it was better but not great. The ingredients listed next to the margaritas on the menu are not accurate so be sure to ask the bartender exactly what's in each one. 

Once we were seated our waiter was extremely nice and did a great job with such a large party! We had 3 orders of the table side guacamole and they were delicious. For dinner, most of us orders appetizer portions because we had filled up on the guac and all the free chips and salsa. My tacos were okay, they came on corn tortillas and I should have asked for flour ones but the carne asada was delicious. I asked for no cilantro but it was on there. I didn't want to send it back because it was already 10:30 and I was just so hungry at that point.

So, the food: if you have it on the menu, you better have it in the kitchen. They were missing a few things which was very disapponting. We shared the scallops which were the best part of the meal- but for $3.33/scallop it better be good. I settled for the salman which was nothing special (salmon is usually a fail safe for me, I always get it if nothing else jumps out at me on the menu- so I've had a lot of salmon throughtout my life.) It was accompanied by heavily peppered carrots & green beans and a ""root puree"" which was just a fancy way of saying mashed potatoes.... which was a tease because I was expecting sweet potato, parsnips or SOMETHING better than a root vegetable I am already fully aware of. Drinks were decent: my bf had a bourbon/cherry martini & I had my favorite- a dry, dirty grey goose martini. Hard to mess those up , though. Desserts were a puffed pastry that lacked any real flavor & a coconut creme brulee that was actually quite good- but just like a baked potato- is pretty hard to mess up.

So when I finally got the chance to go to Yo Sushi I was so excited! It's located at Int'l Mall on the ground floor, in the middle of the mall by the escalators and Godiva. 

I went during lunch time with 3 people on a Tuesday around 1 pm and was promptly seated. 
I ordered about 6 plates, 4 from the conveyor and 2 from my waiter. 
The sushi was pretty good, portions are small for the price but still okay. 
I got this eggplant dish from the belt and it was so good! I love eggplant :)

The prices are determined by the color of the plates. The price came out to about $25 for everything, which wasn't bad considering getting 6 plates. The salmon sushi plates were my favorite, and the popcorn shrimp was so good. 

Only problem we had was one of the dishes my friend ordered (Tuna Tataki) took like 30 minutes to get to us. I don't know if they put it on the belt accidentally or what, but our waiter didn't seem too concerned about my friend waiting so long for what he ordered.

You want them to love you and think you're funny and nice and will want to continue to have you around.  Especially when its your best friend from college, and its her husband of 8 months. 

Now before you all go thinking ""man Michelle's a bad friend!""  I have met him twice... for a total of 5 minutes... once drunk at a tailgate and then in the recieving line at the wedding.  Its just that every time i came to visit them, he had other stuff going on so i never got to hang out.  But this time, I was hanging out with him and was determined to make a good impression.  

The only problem... my friend knows WAY too much about me :)  And knew that when she said, ""I'll get a drink if you have one"", i would get the sangria.  Which was delicious!   Different, but highly delicious...as was her mai tai.   Then was the pressure to order the ""Bloomin Onion"".  Which is awesome, but greasy and gross, but still amazing.  But not something i want this guy i've never met to see me chow down on!  

And rather than ordering a steak, which i really was not in the mood for, i opted for the ""Bloomin Burger"".  MORE BLOOMIN ONIONS!   The burger was thick and juicy and perfectly cooked.  It was topped with cheese and bloomin onions!  Very good.   It came with fries, but i was so full i couldn't even finish them.  

We almost ordered the ""chocolate thunder from down under"" for desert, but i think my friends husband was concerned about his own chocolate thunder from down under!  

The food was good and we called ahead and got on the waiting list to be seated at 715, yet we were seated at 6:50, so that was nice.  I felt like i was going to explode when i left.

Then our deep dish supreme was burnt and left a horrible after taste. The manager offered to make something new...didn't have another 2 hours.

We ordered 312s and an order of mozzarella sticks to start. The beer was a little warmer than I like, but the mozzarella sticks were perfection. Crispy and hot with melty, gooey cheese. Yum. 

Our pizza was well worth the wait. The deep dish ""Stockyard Patty"" came with a buttery crust, slightly sweet sauce, and a perfect disc of sausage. Our pizza was piping hot and drool-worthy.

I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day. 

We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).

All in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.

TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",2015-08-30 19:15:36,312 Pizza Company,371 Monroe St,Nashville,TN,37208,36.177051,-86.787824,3.5,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,0

She was running all over the place delivering pizzas, picking up glasses, refilling beers, and just being super friendly. As someone who has once worked in a restaurant, I know that's not always the case and I just want to give her props!

Ok. So the pizza was really good! We got the thin crust Capone and it was really flavorful. It was unlike most pizza I eat, but I really enjoyed it (think crunchy thin crust, light sauce, light cheese, and non greasy meats). It was light even though it had lots of meat on it, which I thought was amazing. We sat at the bar and the guy next to me said we were making a big mistake by not ordering the Chicago Deep Dish. Looking back I agree with him. Yes, it takes 45 mins to bake, but I will tell you this.. it looked and smelled amazing!! When I saw the waitress walk by with one, I instantly had buyers remorse!!  

The place is small so seating can take awhile, especially if everyone orders a deep dish (45 min wait just for cooking).

Decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess, who looked to be all of 14. Our waitress arrived and that's when it went downhill. Maybe she was new, IDK, but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order. I asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem. I was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra, so I went with catfish instead. Wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well. What next; extra for silverware? There were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either. Anyways, the food came quick and was tasty. Portion size was very good as well. The waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes, at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad, which was supposed to be on the side, was non-existent. About 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar. We were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check. During that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long, lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door. When he left, the girls continued the hug fest, in between customers coming in. Such love amongst the staff! 8 minutes later the check arrived, but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server, too. Going over the bill, at least I didn't get charged for the beer that is still in their tap! Overall, I feel this place is overrated, and it'll probably be quite awhile before I go there again.

Trish was our incredible server, and she had another server at her shoulder. He was always smiling. And he helped a lot.

I made the reservation, specifying that we needed separate checks and that I was paying for the ""man of celebration's"" meal. I double-clarified both points with Trish. She got it, and she was unfazed. These people have nerves of steel.

It went like clockwork. They got in cadence with our program. We were slow, steady and smooth.

A lot of salads were ordered and enjoyed.

I got a cheeseburger (Cheddar, no bun), double pickles, tomato, lettuce and onion. Southern green beans as a side. I don't know what's so Southern about these green beans. But they were flatter and longer. And bacon was involved. Bingo!

An incredibly juicy medium cheeseburger , , , really good. Beef flavor, tender. I want another one.

I think their sauce overpowers the taste of the toppings and cheese - could barely taste the pepperoni.  Light sauce would be my recommendation to others.

We ordered the combos to get a taste of various items.
Food was plated quickly and served with a complimentary beer.
I have to say that for the most part, each item was really excellent. I will elaborate.

Brisket was absolutely perfect! Tons of flavor, super tender, some fat (but that is not only expected, it is desired) The BEST!

Ribs were also super moist, and very flavorful. I read that some reviewers had dry ribs. These were seriously excellent. There were so many BBQ sauces to try too. I have to say that there was little need to put sauce on it... yes, that good.

Pulled pork was great, a tad too salty, but by no means unpleasant like another reviewer stated. Very moist, great flavor

The chicken was a pulled chicken. I guess I should have been clearer and asked for BBQ chicken. The pulled chicken was good, but also a little over salted. It seemed to be white meat that was shredded.

They DO have collards (not on menu). And they were very good

The spinach was a bit better in my opinion as they had a generous amount of garlic and olive oil (very Italian) 

Garlic mashed were very good, Cole Slaw was also very good.

Now that we tasted most of the menu, the standouts for me were the brisket, ribs, and spinach.

Another reviewer was disturbed by the Italian language TV channel. Seriously?  get over it!
The owner/chef is Italian and speaks the language. This also explains why they also have pizza. I cant wait to try the pizza next time.

3349,4355,oXuRc5x1FLLbLVs7vjxPSw,vuAI70USd3my2Kb9_9zajw,4,"Fun fact, I ""recently"" moved somewhat close to the ""Hill"". In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, ""Joey B's on the Hill."" Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.

Now, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.

Joey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]

After looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the ""regular"" half of the pizza.

Yes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.

Luckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.

The pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?

All in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.

Now that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.

Thin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.

Plus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.

Other menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.

So, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:

Food: A-
Atmosphere: B
Service: A
Price: $
Portion Size: Large

It truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends. I definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too. Let me know what you think when you go!

3350,4356,Ba-9cYMl0iZrBs5na6DpfQ,vuAI70USd3my2Kb9_9zajw,3,"I visited Joey B's for lunch today. My experience was just ok. They were busy. The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. 

The decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. 

The menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. 

Overall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. 

BTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a ""cheese"" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've ""been around"" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real.

Whoever takes care of the place does a good job.  Everything is neat, orderly, in place and confortable.

The house salad is a must meal starter, the green onion, salami and provel are nice differences from typical house salads you see elsewhere. The house dressing in creamy but not too heavy. 

The firecracker chicken sandwich has a nice kick but the real star here are the burgers.

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.

Anyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.

While we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.

We ordered:
- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.
- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. 
- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.
- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. 
- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.
- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.

We went for a late dinner. It was a Monday night but I still made a 9:30 reservation. You can never be to sure. We arrived exactly at 9:30 and was seated immediately by Jeff.

We had our choice of tables. We chose a table behind the bar so we could watch the football game. Jeff came over to tell us about the late night happy hour and the dinner specials.

He was very attentive. We ordered 2 daiquiris off the happy hour menu. I had the pineapple crush I believe and bae had a strawberry margarita. 

After reviewing the menu and reading the yelp reviews we decided on an order of devil eggs, a small bowl of gumbo, crawfish spring rolls and chili wings.

The food arrived fairly quickly. It was so much food we didn't know where to start. I started with the crawfish spring rolls and be the deviled eggs. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious. I've never had crawfish before but this roll definitely did it justice.

The deviled eggs were plentiful and the presentation was beautiful.  I'm not a fan of capers so I removed them but the egg overall was very tasty.

The gumbo arrived piping hot and came with 2 slices of bread. It was so good but I had gotten full off of the spring roll and deviled egg so I only ate a couple of spoonfuls. Not to worry, bae finished the rest.

We didn't get to the wings. Jeff was nice enough to wrap them to go.

We were given the bread pudding as a birthday dessert. It arrived warm, deep fried and delicious. Maybe the best bread pudding I've had.

I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.

The manager came over and explained the policy of ""no add-ons"" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be ""allowed"" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.

I said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.

Then the owner came over and very rudely said, ""Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you."" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.

I think I ordered roti cani, but I can't be sure. Definitely some sort of Indian chili chicken which was delish -- the sauce was a fascinating blend of red curry, brown sugar and about 15 other spices I can't put my finger on.

I eschewed a side dish in favor of 2 desserts -- the peanut pancakes, which look and taste exactly as you'd imagine and the falooda/faluda, one of the single most delicious, creatively concocted beverages a have ever had the pleasure of slurping down in 40 seconds. This thing is traditionally made from mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, sweet basil (sabza/takmaria) seeds, and pieces of jelly with milk, often topped off with a scoop of ice cream.

Sounds bizarre. Google it and see. It's okay, I'll wait.

I think the 4th time is the last straw.

For my first symphony, I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience. 

During the first piece, I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.

The acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage, we noticed that the balcony's were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.

Walking around the outside gardens, you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility. 

Its without saying, you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece/song/tune.

On the way back from Philly to our beach house recently, my wife and I stopped in for a sandwich.  We were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress.

My wife's order came with SLICED tomatoes- no biggie- and she just ate it anyway,  I attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the over-microwaved wheat roll. My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato/lettuce.

Andrew Cherng and his parents are from Jiangsu, a province in China. In 1973, Andrew and his father, Chef Ming Tsai Cherng opened their first restaurant in Pasadena, CA. Andrew dreamed of sharing his father's authentic recipes, for delicious Chinese cuisine, with the American people. Andrew also wanted to offer a choice of delicious entr√©es at inexpensive prices. As destiny intervened in Andrew's life, it just so happened that Andrew met Terry Donahue, the head football coach at UCLA and Dan Donahue who was Terry's brother, just so happened to have a Realtor company [Donahue Schriber Real Estate] that managed the Glendale Galleria, an upscale shopping center. Don offered Andrew the opportunity of a lifetime, to develop a fast-food version of his restaurant's entr√©es and his father's delicious recipes.

They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries.

Since casinos rarely like to lose money, it's extremely rare to run across. I found it at Western Village, on the 50-play machines. And they weren't even advertising it - they just slipped it in.

Sadly, I guess too many people caught on, and they eventually reduced it to 9/6/5 - which is still an almost 98-percent payback. Good enough that you really don't need to walk in expecting to lose.

Same goes for the tables - you're usually going to find pretty much the least restrictive rules that you can find in a Nevada casino.

Food. I ordered the Shitaki and Gouda burger with onion straws. It was lacking in mositness and flavor but it was not awful. What saved this meal were the sweet potato fries. They were killer. What killed it was the fact that the order was wrong and I got the wrong fries. The redemption was I tried the regular fries and they were also amazing. 
Beer. I chose to do the 1.75 5 ounce samplers versus the larger beers seeing as I was not sure what I would like. First sample was the raspberry cider. Very sweet, nice good flavor. Not something I could drink more than a 5 ounce sampler but would do again. I also had a Pilsner, the name slips me, it was VERY good. I am a beer wimp and I really enjoyed the flavor.
Service. YIKES. Terrible, awful bad. Appetizers never came. Beers came sporadically. Order was wrong and server threw the kitchen under the bus.

We placed our order or tried at first. My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...

Over an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand ""we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?""  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.  Then came Irate Guy On Phone.  ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THE DRIVER IS!? WHY!?""  My friend and I looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while Irate Guy On Phone kept screaming ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!?,"" Etc.  

Driver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  My friend collected the food and paid the tab.  

The food, mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  Tonight, a little late because of a lovely nor'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time I will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.

But sadly, it's just become a shell of its former glory. The lobster tank was the perfect metaphor for today's experience, vacant cold and empty.

Despite this one star review I think our server Ryan was great. He was personable, friendly and proactive. You do the best you can with which you are given.

Cleanliness: 0 stars. Our table appeared clean but I came to discover that no it's not the table varnish peeling off, it's in fact grease of some nature, most likely butter. The crumb catchers in the booth were full of crumbs and food particles, the menu could have used a wipe down and the silverware was spotty. Even worse were the implements served with the appetizers. The spoon with the lobster and artichoke dip had dried food stuck to it and the greasy mussel spoon had fallen into the broth before getting to the table. The to go boxes had fingerprints all over them and the entree plates weren't much better.

Food quality and taste: 1 star. Food was served hot and in a timely fashion but quality was low. My salad was comprised of ice burg lettuce which is par for chain restaurants, though every piece I received was white. The cherry tomatoes were soft, not firm and the carrot shavings were dry and discolored like they had been sitting around awhile. The mussels were very strong in taste, and not in a good way. I ate only two out of fear that they might not agree with me later. The broth was garlicky and delicious and the lobster artichoke dip was also quite good.

The stuffed flounder entree was served with asparagus cooked within an inch of its life. Limp, and fibrous. The flounder was a very small filet served over the seafood stuffing that had crab shell in it. I didn't finish the small portion because I officially decided today that no matter what or how I try fish, I just don't like it.

Overall, a pretty anticlimactic lunch date served with a side of disappointment.

I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.  
Gio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.

My wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.

My entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini saut√©ed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of saut√©ed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.  
I finished with a double expresso.  

Service:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.

Firstly - super excited about housemade biscuits.  Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for ""normal"" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart. 

My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that. 

I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.

3520,4602,l2tGR2l5EDfJrUTvHY9AFQ,2jvmqojTdrdj3YboXzKRcw,2,"I usually wait a few months before giving a new restaurant a try because every new kitchen needs to ""shake out"" serving and cooking problems. I made an exception with Something Grilled because I am a huge barbecue fan. This used to be a takeout only place in Honey Brook, and they have moved to Exton and opened their first restaurant. Getting to know a new market, and adapting to new staffing issues takes time. Having eaten takeout from here once, and eaten in once, here are my first impressions...  

My takeout order was a rack of ribs with three sides and cornbread. The ribs were dry-rubbed and finished with a sweet Memphis style sauce with no ""heat."" The ribs are baby-back, not regular pork ribs, and for baby-backs were quite meaty and done nicely. They did NOT ""fall off the bone,"" and had just the right amount of ""tooth"" necessary for good ribs. The sides were summer slaw, which was spectacular; competent potato salad, which was potato,milk, butter, and pickle relish style; and mac and cheese, which was suitably creamy and a little stringy with mild white cheddar. The mac and cheese would have benefited from sharp cheddar and a little cayenne; it was pretty bland.

When I stopped by for lunch, I ordered the Carolina pulled pork barbecue sandwich with a side of ranch fries well done. Service was swift, but it was well after the lunch rush. I ordered ice tea, which was brewed (a good sign), and was given a basket of corn muffins and honey-cinnamon butter. The fries were well done as requested, and the sandwich was excellent -- stacked high with pulled pork with a light vinegar sauce and topped with summer slaw. The twist is that they bake a slice of mild white cheddar onto the bottom of the top bun. You barely notice it, but it does help hold the slaw onto the sandwich, otherwise a frequent failing with Carolina 'cue. 

It's pretty easy to criticize a new restaurant. This one is worth giving a little time to shake out any difficulties.",2013-12-07 00:32:13,Something Grilled,"260 N Pottstown Pike, Ste 50",Exton,PA,19341,40.0341555,-75.6335018,3.5,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

The food was nothing special. For an appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the Braised Meatballs (veal) and we both agreed that they were very good. I had the Pear Salad and I thought it was just ok. My boyfriend had the Eggplant parm, which he enjoyed. I tried a bite of his pasta just to sample the sauce. It wasn't bad. I had the Penne Pinoli and couldn't eat more than a few bites.

I've had lunch here several times and never had a bad choice.  Today, I opted for the ""Homewrecker"":  a big, honkin' flour burrito crammed full of steak, black beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and pico de gallo (also available with pork, ground beef, chicken or tofu.)  All ingredients are fresh and packed with great flavor.

 - always a GREAT burrito...among the very best I've ever had!  (and filling, too!)  Also, their chips are made fresh and have a good flavor and crispness.  Finally, I like the choices of spicy and mild salsas.

Just two nits:

 - Salsa service.  I HATE having to fill three or four small containers to meet my needs.  I'd prefer to have a choice of a larger container.  Also, the area is too small to permit you to comfortably set your meal and drink down while dispensing without fear of being nudged by another or passing customer.  More elbow room in the salsa area would be great.

- Cleanliness.  It seems that the tail-end of the lunch hour gets greeted with a bit of a mess on the floors beneath the booths.

Been a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.

One thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.

All in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.

The soups were amazing! I had a crab chowder and it was full of crab, not too creamy and great seasoning. 

The second time we came, I ordered the crab cake sandwich. The brioche bun was a little too much for the 6 oz crab cake. I had to gut out the bun. That allowed me to enjoy the crab cake more. 

The next day my sister came to visit and wanted to try it. This time we ordered the crab balls. Definitely not as good as the crab cakes. It was full of fillers and not a great way to introduce my sister to it.

There really isn't a lot of variety around the 8000 block of Airline in Metairie. Hobnobber is somewhat close by on West Metairie Ave.

Anyway, in the ~2 years that I've worked at my current job, I hadn't tried Hobnobber. I'm not really a seafood fan and their menu consists of a lot of seafood entrees. If you like seafood, this might be the place for you. I finally gave in and accompanied some co-workers last week. 

They recommended the Italian entrees, if I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I opted for the eggplant parmesan. While I didn't have high expectations, it was really quite good. I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).

If you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.

Thanks Yelpers. This was a winner. The portions were generous. The fish excellent - few get excellent for the fish. Simply said - why eat sushi - for the fish. 
Tuna,salmon, white tuna, yellow tail. Great

Soup ok but not why I was there. Service good. Price - always spend too much with my teenage sushi loving companions but pricing was a bit lower than some others. 

Had a spicy tuna roll as well - good for a roll.  Companion had Fantasy Roll - it was very good.

We also had to flag our waitress (older, petite, blondish hair) down to order more drinks after a 45 minute wait between beverages!!!!

The food is excellent, however my husband had the ribs (his usual) last night and he said they tasted phoned in. My lasagna was perfection and I'm glad I ordered it rather then my usual steak and potato. 
The highlight is always the parkinglot. There is a Porsche GT3RS that always makes me smile and when I am able to park next to it in my Cayenne Turbo (yes, I know, I am not your typical woman...I love cars.) I imagine what it would be like to ""accidentally"" swap keys with whomever owns that car.

I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle, so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar!

We also shared the French toast and the chopped chicken salad.  The French toast came with two slices and apples.  We didn't need to add any extra syrup.  It was wonderful and sweet.  The chopped chicken salad was also great.

The lettuce was a mix of greens.  The bacon was thick cut pieces, and the chicken was plentiful.  In addition the vinegarette was great. It went perfectly with the salad.

For the birthday person I requested the bread pudding-pretty presentation but improvement on the recipe needed- too dry, either microwaved too much or not enough moisture in the recipe- glad it was comp'd-would not have been happy to have paid for it. 
Overall the atmosphere was nice, pretty renovation of the place that used to be a Copeland's, all of the condiments were served in little cups, which was ok but a squeeze bottle of Blue Plate mayo was on the table, very out of place, but at least it was Blue Plate (the only mayo of Louisiana!).

I don't believe in auto gratuity, I know everyone doesn't tip like they should, I always do and usually give more depending on service received with a smile, but when auto, I never give more. Just my policy, I have family whom work in the service industry whom depend on their tips so I understand a lot of people don't even tip.

3610,4723,yNAmr9WPJjC05wTXiIap9A,Y3ZCO17N1_T_Ms1JmswwzA,2,"During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. 

During dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: 

Tortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. 

Shrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. 

Sauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. 

Beans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. 

Horchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. 

Pina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade.

The corn tortillas are handmade: very thick, soft, and tasty. The fish portion was generous, and they are dressed with pico de gallo and flavorful creamy sauce.   Pickled onion and radish shavings are served on the side and make a nice garnish, as does their (not too hot) red sauce. 

I got the plate, which comes with beans, rice, and a drink. The beans were creamy and had a great flavor. Rice was ordinary , but mix it with the rice, drip a little hot sauce on it and the flavors blend perfectly. You also get pickled carrot slices and they were great too.   I got their homemade horchata, and it was awesome too --cinnamon and spices--just right. They don't serve any alcohol. 

The only drawback is the location. It is not in the best part of town.   And note the name--it is a taqueria--a taco shop. You order at a counter and go sit at metal tables.

Both are cool in that they are open 24 hours, but IHOP seems to have a larger menu and more variety. ...Especially on their breakfast items. They get seasonal options that I like as well.

This particular IHOP is fairly near to where we live, so it's convenient. It's also right off the Interstate and it seems like its always got a steady crowd there. There are 2 motels next to it and Rummel High School is around the corner. From the various times I have been here, it seems to be a mix of high school students and out of town visitors.

I like going at night best and ordering breakfast. Breakfast is served all day. If you don't feel like breakfast, they have a lunch and dinner selection instead.

Salt and pepper chicken wings- Very good, not quite as fried/crispy as other places' salt baked wings, but still good.

Scallion pancake- Very good. Fluffier than most places I usually have it. They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.

Taiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.

Beef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.

The food is still great, and the service staff is great too. It has to with the shady business practices of this establishment. We come to this restaurant on a regular basis. My issue is, lately every time we come here they try to price gouge us. Most times when I order a certain menu item, they charge me the lunch price because I order a smaller portion. Depending on the day and the server, the price changes every time. Most recently I ordered only a child's cheese quesadilla, nothing else. I was charged full price for an entire kids meal. I was told when I questioned it that the ""manager"" made him charge me that way. Also on a separate occasion we were way overcharged for margaritas. This issue is now happening so frequently, that I refuse to return.

My mother, a regular customer, stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn't want to inconvenience customers that may enter, since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn't even even greet her.  

Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.  

8 minutes after her soup was served, and midway through eating her meal, the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.  

As she left with my kid in hand, another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn, or damaged, just wrinkly.

My mother didn't want to create a scene, so she took her wrinkly money back, paid with a credit card with no tip, ha!  

Anyways, food is okay, but it's certainly a shame both service and ownership are such wrinkle-free-money nazis.

I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.

Claire came to us shortly after and was super knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate for one of our party members who has an allergy. I started with the chai tea latte- so delicious. Then got a kefta platter. Once the food came out I realized it was the kefta sandwich but Claire and the manager figured everything out straight away and fixed my order (thanks guys!). The kefta was super moist, the hummus was A1 and their fries were seasoned to the max. Though I think their tabouli could have more lemon- just my preference though. Afterwards I finished with a rose and pistachio cruller which was so light and airy. Y'all gotta try it.

What a pleasant surprise to find Chopstix and have a really superior experience!  I'm very strictly gluten-free, and they have a real gluten-free menu with about 6 pages, not just a handful of choices.  My husband ordered the orange chicken, the same meal as he had at GM for a true comparison, and raved about how much better it was at Chopstix. I had a lettuce wrap appetizer - almost $2 off during happy hour - consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself, and was incredibly tasty!  I loved it so much I ordered a second one, had about 4-5 more wraps out of it, then had to have them box up the rest.  I hated to have to stop eating, it was so good but I was so full!  I have a medical situation where I have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner, and I can't remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me - and most of the time, it's rare that I can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them.

So the service was excellent, the food was **outstanding**, and I had a lovely conversation with the manager, whose last day it was.  He has worked with the Southern Arizona Celiac Association, so the employees at Chopstix are extremely well-educated re gluten issues there, which is great because I got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at Native New Yorker, due to poor education on gluten cross-contamination (they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading.)

I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. 

I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. 

My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. 

The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put.

Unfortunately there was a clan of about a dozen senior citizens in front of me that couldn't make up their minds. 

I walked out, got back into my car and went right to the drive thru. The employee taking my order was clear through the speaker and very polite. I got to the window and realized I forgot an item and she added it on my order, updated my price and took care of it very easily. 

The drive thru process saved me a few minutes, as I'm sure the staff inside was just as efficient as the drive thru staff. 

My food was good and hot when I ate it. The fries didn't have a ton of salt, which I really prefer. My burger wasn't very big but was good. 

Inside was a very nice flat screen TV, which I have never seen in any Wendy's before. They also have the Coke freestyle machine, which is a very nice feature. This Wendy's is by far one of the nicer locations in all of Tampa. 

My issue with Wendy's is that they advertise these huge juicy burgers on TV. They look fantastic but when you unwrap them it's very disappointing as they are extremely small. I get that every restaurant does this during advertising, but Wendy's really exaggerates their product on TV.

This line situation has ALWAYS been the case, and I've been coming here since I was little girl when trips home from grandmas on I-70 meant taking a detour off the interstate to Gray Brothers Cafeteria. The lines may be long, but the place is huge, there are at least 3 very large rooms for dining, so don't worry about not being able to get a seat. The wait staff is friendly and will help carry your trays, bring you drink refills, etc. 

Gray's certainly has the best tasting cafeteria food I've ever had. If I didn't go through the line looking at all the options myself, I would have thought someone's grandma or mom was back there serving up all of these home cooking favorites. 

Obviously, the strawberry pie is iconic. It is good, a little sweet and syrupy for me. I like the sugar cream pie better personally. 

And again, obviously, the fried chicken is also iconic. But that is finger licking good. Sometimes I opt for the chicken strips because I find them easier to eat - but all of their chicken is tasty. As are all of their meat and fish entrees I've tried. 

Now for the sides. THE SIDES. I am a mac n cheese expert, let me tell you, and this is the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Perfection. I wish I could get that for my entree. 

The mashed potatoes and gravy are great, the green beans are great, the corn is great, heck, even the broccoli is great.

I had the breaded pork tenderloin with whiite gravy, which was massive and just incredible. It is so not to eat something you know was just made.

The dining room is rather small. Luckily Taste of India has a buffet so I didn't have to decide on just one meal. It was a rather small buffet but gave alot of variety. The place was empty when we arrived right before noon but starting getting busier as we were leaving. 

I tasted pretty much a bit of everything. It was a very filling meal. Luckily I went with someone who knew his stuff and explained every dish and what I could expect from them. The rice mixed with the chana masala seemed to be my favorite. Pick and choose what you like then go up for seconds :) 

The desserts were good. It was interesting at first but give them a shot. I was surprised at how good they were. 

The staff was pretty adamant about refilling our glasses of water. I felt they were at our table every couple of minutes. Maybe they should get bigger cups or leave a pitcher of water on each table. 

We paid a little over $11 for our lunch (each). After reading some other reviews I see they changed their pricing a bit.

The one time that we ordered the Caprese Salad, the cheese texture was soggy and lacking flavor.  We found that this preparation of the salad was inedible.  The manager came to the table to explain the ""artisan"" cheese and how it is sometimes not created in a consistent quality.

Atmosphere-
This restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.
Service-
Our waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. 
Food- 
I loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!

I might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable.

Like Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  

As serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  

The atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.",2012-07-16 01:34:13,Il Giardino,907 N Bethleham Pike,Spring House,PA,19477,40.1813198,-75.2272608,4.0,1,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

Meal favorites: For Sunday brunch, I loved the McLloyd - pancakes smothered in maple syrup with eggs, cheese, and sausage - perfect if you like sweet and savory together for breakfast. He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  

You can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon.

3826,5073,r-IwgjtjPr7xrlx8aJm7ig,DytKODMqcvQ7MWA0NN2uNw,3,"Last weekend my girlfriend and I , both half insane with cabin fever, decided to walk up to Girard Ave and grab a bite to eat and a couple drinks. As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. 

Then we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. 
My immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think ""whiskey bar"" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. 

But enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.

I got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.

Overall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well.

Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to, there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a ""good"" sushi bar. Three are in Japan, 2 are in Los Angeles, 1 is in San Francisco, 2 are in New York, and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia, a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way.
Any good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice, prepared properly, excellent fish, and a dab of some good home-made ""wasabi"". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place.
Small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry, those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats, but when the place is full, they are running around like crazy, serving food, taking orders, busing tables, and seating new parties. The wait can be long, but it is worth it.
All of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi, and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna, salmon, super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues), and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture, quality, taste, and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day. 

The good food doesn't stop at the sushi, though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ""oh-my-goodness this is amazing"".

For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.

The Izumi roll, scallops, and sashimi sampler were all great, although I've had slightly better tuna at other restaurants. Don't skip dessert here! The ""un donut"" dessert was unexpectedly delicious--almost like a cider donut, served fresh, hot, and crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Considering the portion sizes you get in a typical sushi restaurant, I thought they were quite generous (the veggie tempura is a meal in itself).

The ambiance inside the restaurant is terrible - they've got some major issues.  First, the bathroom wasn't clean. Then, since it was a cold rainy day I was freezing inside with the fans on and asked them to turn off the fans. They had to pull out a ladder and climb up to the ceiling fans to turn them off. The booths are shoddily put together. The inside looks really run down.  We weren't offered beverages.  Then, a woman worker arrived and proceeded to BLAST, and I mean BLAST the music.  Look, me and my husband were the only people in the restaurant, I felt like she was trying to get us to leave.  First, some really inappropriate song came on - which she changed.  Then, she let TWO Adele songs play on full blast. Followed by some Glee/High School Musical Remix of ""I think I'm gonna marry you"". It was our worst nightmare.  So let me be clear, take your pizza to go. The interior of the restaurant gets zero stars.

I'm glad my husband convinced me to stay, because the pizza was phenomenal.  We've tried many a pizza places in St. Louis and this one is the best.  New York style, no provel, excellent sauce, excellent crust. The best!

A few days ago I read Jackie W.'s review of SLNPC and I knew that we would have to give this place a try.  Fast forward to a lazy Sunday afternoon with both of us hungry and craving some pizza.  SLNPC is literally 5 blocks from our house, so it was a no brainer to give this place a try.  

We walk in and the place is empty, but it had only been open about 10 minutes so I didn't let that deter us.  We had our choice of seats and were quickly helped by Zack.  As we were already quite hungry and not wanting to wait for a pizza to be made, we just grabbed some slices.  I opted to go simple and just go with the peperoni like my son.  Six minutes later I was staring two large New York style pieces of pizza in the face.  Big B delivered our pizza and when I asked for a knife to cut my son's pizza up he quickly offered to take it back and cut it up for me.  That was really cool, as anyone who has tried to cut a giant piece of pizza into bite size pieces with a plastic knife knows is no easy task.  

Now, on to the pizza.  It was delicious, I inhaled both of my giant pieces and my five year old son pretty much ate all of his piece.  He left about 3 bites and the crust.  I was completely full, but very satisfied.  To follow in tradition, I folded my slice in half and was please to see the bottom of the slice cooked perfectly.   

Zack was kind enough to offer my son a Popsicle which made him very happy.  Prices were pretty good for a per slice deal.  The prices on their signature pizzas were reasonable as well.  Next time I venture into this place I will have to try the Big Baller as Jackie W.'s description of it still makes me very hungry.

The noodles have a different texture than that of regular ramen noodles, and they were definitely tasty.

Service is pretty good and quick.  The boyfriend and I arrived just when they opened for the day, but our appetizers and mie didn't take long to come out.

Our orders and our living social voucher were taken. Then there was apparently a problem with our voucher and a lot of back and forth w the waitress. Finally we were told it was ok but the waitress asked us for our order again bc she never put it in once there was a problem w the voucher! 

Eventually the food came and it was just ok. I got the curry goat. It was mostly bones (large and small) and fat sadly, though the flavor was decent. It came with fried plantains which I love but these tasted like they had been reheated or microwaved or something. My husband got the jerk chicken which was full of little splinter bones. He had to be careful w every bite. He said the flavor was good but very spicy. 

I thought the prices seemed high considering the quality of the food and you get served water in disposable plastic cups (yet cloth napkins...). Also, you have to go outside to get to the bathroom which is pretty inconvient when it's raining out. Must be really annoying in the winter!

Softer, more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too, they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.

Customers are mostly Penn students, business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons. 

Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar.

I'm usually a strawberry and chocolate kind of girl, so perusing the selection of flavors I was disappointed not to see a single berry flavor.  But then I caught a sign that said ""Avocado (trust us...)"", and being the avocado lover that I am, asked for a sample.  IT WAS AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously.  I ordered a small cone with Avocado & Nutella (you can never go wrong with nutella anything), and I can hands down say that this was the best gelato I've ever had.

We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  

As is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two ""stalls"" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!

When the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   

The dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.

We all ordered off of the happy hour menu which had 16 options for $6 dollars apiece.  Their regular menu is also massive so there is sure to be something to satisfy just about anyone. 

We ordered zucchini sticks and jalapeno popper for appetizers.  There wasn't really anything special about the jalapeno poppers; there was no spice to them at all.  I'm the type that likes my stuff mild but this was no spice at all!  The zucchini sticks were good and I liked the size, they were more like a big French fry size which made them easier to share.  The zucchini wasn't especially impressive but anything deep fried is usually good.

 I ordered the beef sliders with a salad.  Two of my girlfriends got the chicken fingers and another got the chicken Philly.  Mine was certainly the best presentation; it was the best part about the meal too.  My sliders were served on Hawaiian rolls which were good but the patties were actually one hamburger patty cut into four pieces which I thought was really lame... If you're going to serve a slider at least make individual patties for it or don't even bother.  The hamburger was also really dry and had to be doused in mayo and ketchup in order to be eaten without choking.  The salad was good.  My girlfriends that got the chicken fingers were happy with them but I could tell that they probably came frozen and all Bully's did was fry them.  The chicken Philly was definitely the least impressive meal; the chicken was left in huge, tough, chunks and there was mention of quite a bit of gristle which is a deal breaker for me.   My friend picked at it a little but ended up eating hardly any of it.

The service was fine overall; no extra points for great service and no deducts for bad service either.  I would recommend going to Bully's for the great drink specials.  If you are going to get food stick with anything fried; Bully's doesn't get any extra points for being special or unique. The food had a good price but I can't say I would want to pay more than $6.00 for it.

Ambiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  

FOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.

If you're a fan of New Orleans style or southern food in general, you will love the St. Louis twist they put on the food here. There is just enough kick to it without being overpowering. We tried a bit of everything. The poblano grits were a favorite as well as the roffignac cocktail made with sparkling ros√©- a perfect blend between the raspberry and lemon. 

Randall, our server was super patient. He realized we were there to take our time, and we did not feel rushed. He did his best to answer questions and cater to allergies. Many of the menu items contain shrimp, but they are well aware this is a problem for many people and can make accommodations.

Drinks, we tried several of the house cocktails of Sazarac's (repeated numerous times) & Joe Christmas were very solid.  Kudos to the mixologist - not everyone can consistently craft cocktails - at least in my extensive research.
Also various local draft beers were tried and a Bordeaux for good measure.
Apps of blackened shrimp and hominy hush puppies were tasty.  Dinner ranged from Blackened Red Fish Po'Boy served w/ Cajun chips, crab stuffed Missouri catfish to Shrimp & Grits. All were pleased with our choices and nothing remained once we were done. Dessert of Whiskey Caramel baked Alaska was shared.

5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...

They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.


For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.

We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree.

Cold rice, chicken over cooked and dry (both my G/F's & my dish), my enchiladas was cold, red sauce tasted weird. G/F's flour tortilla was browned in cold grease as it didn't really brown, just sucked up the grease. My soda was flat, not enough carbonation to it....was also warm that the ice melted within 5 minutes of taking it to the table, so soda got watered down...

The candle center piece in the center of the table was glued down so one has to eat to the side of the table...very strange.

I just ordered a pizza from Empire and they said they are currently out of cheese and can't make my one pizza. HTF do you run out of cheese at 6 PM when you're a pizza place? I understand there's a Cardinals game on tonight, but management is supposed to take things like that into consideration when running a pizza business.
What's even a bigger joke is the fact they are supposed to be open until midnight tonight. So I guess it's only Italian roast beef sandwiches and cola for anyone who tries walking in for a pizza.  

This isn't the only order fail I've had with this place. It's not uncommon for them to not answer the phone or to be out of certain ingredients on a regular basis. There's no point in looking at the menu because you have a 50/50 chance it won't be there. 

Maybe they need to hire new management who will know how to keep up with the high volume, otherwise I can see this place losing a lot of customers over the next few years and eventually closing just based on the fact it's a gamble when one goes to order their food. Talk about an unsustainable flash in the pan business model that's obvious at it's peak. Too bad it's only down hill from here. (I am writing this review hoping the owner reads it and actually does something about the problem. I'm sick of bottom feeding business owners who don't care). 

The pizza was good the one time I was able to order it, though. But certainly not worth going through the headache of dealing with them again.

I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure.

Where we live, we get some pretty good sushi, but it's nothing like the sushi we had when we ate at IRB Sushi. Holy smokes it was delicious! Often here in Cincinnati, we often treat ourselves to sushi when the few places around here offer half-priced sushi deals on certain nights of the week. For the price and quantity we had here, it blows every single place we go to locally, right out of the water. The fish was delicious and fresh, the rolls were beautifully crafted, it was truly an enjoyable meal and we both enjoyed every single bite we had. For the two of us to have 5 rolls, and two house salads, the damage was a mere $53. We looked at the bill and our jaws just dropped. That's such an inexpensive tab for the meal that we had. The server we had was great, she was attentive, and kept our drinks filled, despite being completely busy. My only concern was the amount of open space in the actual restaurant felt a little... empty. Like they could have fit at least 3 or 4 more 4-top tables in.

So the beautiful wife and I stopped by Mojo tonight.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little ""hidden.""  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?

Wrong.

So, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.

Finally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him ""long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.""

So, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).

Anyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):

Tuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.

Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.

Garlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was ""this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.

Chicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.

It might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.

Like any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.

When we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.  Or something.

I don't think we'll be going back -- there's nothing really too exciting going on here.",2010-08-21 02:51:46,Mojo Tapas,3117 S Grand Blvd,Saint Louis,MO,63118,38.6022635,-90.2425258,3.5,0,1,,,1,1,0,0,0,1

As a New York native I live by the credo that only pizza which can be folded in half can actually be considered pizza. While the cheese to sauce ratio was slightly in favour of the queso the crust was solid enough to uphold the amount of grease, which personally I found refreshing.

I'm just another fan dropping a review or....""revamped"" review in my case, and just letting the Yelpdom know.....The quality of the food you get here for the price is ""Asinine"" some would even say ""Bananas"" but all in the best of ways. Here we go..

The Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!

They have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from..
Chicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general ""Diner"" style motif going on here. 

The service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say ""suck it up"" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.

When you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..

Split Pea
Clam Chowder
Chicken Noodle

You could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. 

In closing, ""All hands on Deck"" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you ""Must"" visit when you are out here in Reno.

The Good- I am struggling to find something amazing about it. I wouldn't say good but just ok the Cuban and Mac and cheese (needs salt and pepper). Our waiter rocked though.

The Bad- not sure I would classify this as a gastro pub based off 3 factors: 

1. the ambiance it's more of a sports bar/ banquet with white linens, weird wall paper, big screen tvs playing sports and a big wide open space, a true gastro pub should have a cozy or rustic vibe that makes you want to relax and enjoy it. 

2. Should have extensive craft beer and cellar beer list... I believe  they had 20 beers most were domestic bud, bud light and the like. 

3. The food should be out of the box or fun plays on food. But it was just ok those Blue Chips where very bad though...Very bland blue sauce that seemed to be mixed with whole milk and was watery and tasteless. They could make it  amazing with chunks of blue, thicker sauce and something more to cut the salt on salt flavor.

The Ugly- craft beer 101 don't bring me a beer with a frosted mug it makes you seem like you don't know what your doing. You do not ever ever ever bring a beer in a frosted glass it waters the beer down. Also live band outside was way to loud.

The Low Down Foo- I think this place has an identity crisis... It's called a gastro pub but does have any of the features of one... But looks like a sport bar / private even space. 

I wish them the best but they just don't have any reason to get us back... Out of the 3 categories we rate gastro pubs this one failed all 3.",2015-06-21 01:22:49,Social Gastropub,2 157 Center,Edwardsville,IL,62025,38.7848922,-89.9791545,3.5,0,1,,,1,0,0,0,0,1

The tortillas for the two tacos were stale but the pork was good and fresh vegetable fillings.  $4

The vietnamese crepe was AWFUL.  I'm not sure if it is the way it was prepared or if I just hate Vietnamese crepes.  It was like an undercooked eggy tasting omelet with tons of cold bean sprouts and thinly sliced cold shrimp and other grossness.

It's unclear how you're supposed to find a table, but customers are just supposed to grab a table. There's a sort-of line that forms by the bar, but no one working there organizes it at all.

We sat down quickly, but I think it was just lucky timing because for the rest of our meal people were waiting to sit. Also, there's only one bathroom and it took FOREVER to use it. They seriously need to have more than just one bathroom.

I ordered the crab cakes florentine, which were really good. The potatoes needed more spice (aka hot sauce) but the meal was really flavorful. The chef cooked the eggs perfectly, but there was nothing to scoop up the runny egg with since there was no bread. My friend ordered the french toast and it was not impressive. Just a few slices of bread with cinnamon and some egg on top. Not filling or visually stunning. 

Our waitress was not particularly nice and seemed angry with us when we didn't want to order drinks. Many people did seem to have their food and then get a drink to-go as they walked around Jackson Square.

Anything more involving fried oysters, more crawfish, more fried anything, hard cajun spices, LSU and Saints decor, the locals wouldn't come.

Now the food, its good. Not awesome, but I don't expect it to be. I had the pick three; Crawfish Casserole, Gumbo and Jambalaya. All fair sizes, all had a little kick. I would go again on my way through Carmel. More of a lunch place than dinner, but thats up to you.

They do have some healthy options, which I recall from a while back and was nice to see them again.

I'll gladly make the trek from south city to O'Fallon to get this delicious, superior and value Thai.

Having been twice, I am ashamed to admit that I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles so I have had that each visit, albeit once chicken and once pork.

The appetizers are delicious.  Have tried the spring rolls, chicken satay and chicken pot-stickers and they were all satisfying.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a ""sinus opening experience"" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being ""not fresh"" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It's where I'll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I'll go for takeout when the urge hits.

It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon, IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated, simple, earthy, and contemporary.

They have a few Chinese items on the menu, but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!  

Today, we sampled the tofu yellow curry, pad Thai, Thai sweet & sour shrimp, & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!

Vegetarians will like Aroy, as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.

The food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high, but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.

I give it three stars instead of four mainly because it's probably not on my top 10 places in Reno for Mexican food. Chipotle is not even my favorite Mexican-themed chain restaurant. That would be El Pollo Loco.
For my meal I got a burrito with beef, black beans, white rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and maybe some other stuff. I added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce.
I had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times I came. The staff was friendly when I placed my order. I got my burrito, chips and salsa when I paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later.
Chipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food. The chips are good quality chips. The salsa tastes mass produced. It was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times. My favorite salsas are the red salsa from the Michoacan region of Mexico with its nice garlic kick. 
The ingredients in the burrito were fresh, but there were two significant flaws. No. 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else. Usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans, but not in this case. It made the burrito bland and a little dry. The second flaw was all the gristle I found on the beef. My tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time I finished. I decided to spare Yelpers a photo of that.
The margarita was okay. I'd get one again but it was routine.
There's basically two kinds of wine bars: Those that serve wine that wine geeks like (these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving) and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink. I get the sense that Chipotle is a Mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there.  Again, for a chain, they serve good quality food. I can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town. 
Chipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking. For people who have never had a good chipotle in a Mexican restaurant, I would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla (devil shrimp) at La Fuente in Sparks. It's quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at Chipotle but it has great depth of flavor.",2014-03-15 21:49:04,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"6395 S Mccarran Blvd, Unit A",Reno,NV,89509,39.4774686077,-119.7931618635,3.0,1,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have not been blown away by anything, and the flavors of the dishes I have sampled (Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mumbia Dal, and Navratan Korma) were fairly muted.

I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean.

If you have read my other reviews on yelp, you know I have tried several different Indian restaurants, so I'm very familiar with the cuisine and what to expect.
What I like about Mumbai Bistro:
1) The prices -- most affordable Indian food. If you're on a budget like me, this is perfect.
2) Simple, easy-to-understand menu. It also tells you what's spicy, what's gluten free, what contains dairy.
3) Fast service. Even if you don't call in and order ahead for take-out, they get your to-go order ready in 5-10 mins.
4) The food taste and quality is good. Good selection of appetizers and entrees. It's not THE best Indian food ever (you get what you pay for), but it's always good, enjoyable.

I stopped by when these guys came to Flicks and Food Trucks and had heard their desserts were awesome. Being someone that loves desserts, I had to give them a try. Looking at the menu, I noticed they had some more unusual flavors. Chai tea and honey? Hmmm. Sounds interesting.

So, I got the chai tea and honey cupcake with cream cheese frosting. And since I initially couldn't decide between that flavor and the chocolate caramel, I obviously got both. 

The chai tea cupcake was amazing. Perfect spice cake flavor and the cream cheese frosting was rich and perfectly creamy. 

The chocolate caramel cupcake was good as well. The cake itself was moist and chocolatey, and the buttercream icing was light, smooth and not too sweet.

And yes, I had both of them in the same sitting. Too tempted not to.

It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues.

To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town.

Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that.

Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong.

Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you 'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you.

We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch.

There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it.

My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.

I liked the ambience and feel to it, because it kind of made me feel like it was an exotic escape especially from the surrounding neighborhood.  

There was plenty of seating which was great.  Most Thai restaurants I've visited have been a little smaller and more intimate, and this place gives you enough breathing room.  Coming from Chicago, my favorite place near the UIC Campus was Thai Bowl on Taylor St.  Cheap and good Thai food with a student discount and delivers to the dorms.  

The food was great, and having a Thai friend order food that I wasn't familiar with was all the better.  I'm more of an ""eat what you know"" type of person, and sometimes I'm scared to venture out.  But the Tom Kha (sp?) - Coconut (Milk) Soup was delicious.  I have to say I'm not a fan of either mushrooms or coconut, but I have to say it was a great combination.

Did not compare - however the rest of the food - including sausage , bacon , eggs and pancakes was yummy .  I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were a
Bit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .

I loved the oversized comfortable furniture. It's a combination of industrial and a beach feel. I loved the appearance of the bar and all of the decorative touches down to the painting of the rest room doors. I loved the different shades of woods used paired with shades of blues and white. It was very spacious and open and the place is much larger then I initially realized. Unfortunately the decor was the best thing about this location.

We started off with a margarita pizza. There was an excessive amount of flour on the dough. Enough that all 6 of us noticed and tasted it. Our waiter was friendly but unable to make any suggestions about the menu when asked. The servers that brought the food were unpleasant and  just did a drop and run. 

I ordered the  huevous ranchos. It was presented in a beautiful manner. There was a strong taste of citrus which I am not a fan of. I was unable to eat the dish and sent it back. Two people ordered shrimp and grits. The grits had no seasoning, had no taste of butter and had a lumpy consistency that we all disliked. Someone ordered the mango chutney grilled cheese. It looked fantastic but his response was that it was blah. We had a child with us who ordered silver dollar pancakes. Instead of smaller kid friendly pancakes 3 larger pancakes were served. Two people ordered the yogurt parfait. It said it was layered with strawberry compote but instead it was fresh strawberries, blueberries and a sprinkling of granola. The oddest food preparation to me was the side of scrapple someone ordered. It came deep fried. I'm a scrapple connoisseur. I have never seen scrapple served like this. It should be on the menu if it isn't going to be prepared as it usually is. It was very crispy but way to greasy and made this scrapple lover pass it onto the next person to try.

First, I ordered the tom yum soup.  They asked me how spicy I wanted it and I responded that I wanted it spicy.  I did not expect that the entire bowl of soup would be covered in red pepper flakes.  Disgusting. I spent ten minutes picking red pepper flakes out of the soup and my mouth.  

  I also tried the chicken satay.  The chicken was ice cold and as dry as beef jerky. The dipping sauce was a mix between curry and Planter's honey roasted peanuts.  It was a bizarre combination like nothing I've ever had before.  Once again...Disgusting. 

  Finally, I ordered curry.  I had high hopes that they could not screw up everything in my order.  Boy was I wrong.  The curry was bland and just plain gross. 

Overall, all 8 of the people in my group left the restaurant dissatisfied. My recommendation is that you walk two blocks down the road and eat at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant.",2011-09-25 22:12:47,Rearn Thai,7910 Bonhomme Ave,Saint Louis,MO,63105,38.6474137,-90.3393029,2.5,1,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Positives - Creative menu. The waiter was very polite and attentive. Drinks were great (nice Bourbon cocktails).  Beer selection was also good. Prices are reasonable. 

Negatives - Most of the food was poorly done, despite a very long wait time. Every one in our party complained about the over use of salt. The fried chicken was inedible due to the salt and funky taste in the batter (something was definitely off). The waiter apologized but made no effort to remedy the issue.  The chicken was left untouched on the plate. The bacon used on the grilled cheese and burgers had too much fat. The sweet potato fries were overly cooked.

4305,5936,5hWFcCSePTWiJm-4IrP4aA,PxEiXqMAzzvp8GFlb5EoLg,1,"Went there for an early dinner on a Sunday. We left disappointed with the food and service. Originally, we were impressed by the reviews on Yelp and we had passed it a couple of times when we were dining in that area before. I was actually looking forward to dining here...when we arrived, we were seated quickly. There was one other table with customers but they were just leaving. The staff was standing at the bar watching/cheering a game on a tv over the bar. 

Our server was friendly but seemed distracted. We ordered the crawfish dip, a couple of beers, buttermilk chicken sandwich, mac n cheese, and the chocolate cake for dessert. The appetizer took about 20 mins. to arrive...they did eventually come out to tell us something was wrong with the oven and they would remove it from our check out of courtesy. We were then served our meals and about 15 mins later, our appetizer arrived. 

The buttermilk chicken sandwich: the chicken itself was soggy and/or very greasy, the kale or greens on the sandwich were soggy from being soaked in honey or grease maybe?? It looked unpleasant. Normally, greasy wouldn't be so bad with a nice crunch. This didn't have that. The mac n cheese had a good smokey flavor from the bacon. The crawfish dip had good flavor as well...very cheesy and tangy. The bread it came with was toasted and slightly burnt around the edges. It was hard to chew or cut. Before we were asked if we wanted dessert, our server brought us the check. Maybe he wanted us to leave so that they can all continue watching the game without interruption, but it was strange. We asked if we can order dessert and he took our order. The chocolate cake was dense...a huge portion that was good for sharing. Not sure if the cake was stale or just hard from being refrigerated but it was hard to cut with a knife. I actually thought it might be frozen but it wasn't.  It had good flavor though. 

So, it wasn't a horrible experience but with all the dining options in and around Philly, we will not be returning even if it was an off night for them.

Walking in, I am immediately struck by how pretty the place is.  Lots of wood, muted colors... very calming.  Add to that the eclectic mix of music, albeit heavy on classic jazz - Miles, Coltrane, Theolonius - and some classic blues - Billie Holiday, Nina Simone... the overall effect is soothing.  After a hectic day at work, sipping a glass of wine at the bar, I feel like I wandered into a little oasis. I grew up in NYC, so this place definitely takes me back to rainy days in the city where jazz just seemed to be the perfect expression of the day.

So, enough about the atmosphere.  Let's talk about what truly makes unplugged special - the booze. Before writing this review, I have been to unplugged four times.  Every time, I have sat at the bar versus a table.  Nothing wrong with the tables there, but to anyone who knows me then you know what a chatty Cathy I can be .  

Frank, the owner and frequently the bartender, is an absolute joy to chat with about wine.  My first time going here, I ordered a flight of whites.  I was so impressed that Frank poured each glass and then explained a little about the wine I was about to taste.  He then waited until I finished the glass I had before pouring the next.  His passion and knowledge of wine are clearly evident.  In subsequent visits, I have always sat at the bar to be able to chat with Frank or whomever is bartending.  All of the staff that I have encountered have always been warm, knowledgeable, and passionate about wine.

Speaking of the wine... I love that their wines are unusual.  Since Frank is a native German, it is not at all surprising that many of the wines are German.  However, don't expect to see only Rieslings.  There are Gewurtz's, Spatleses, Kabinetts, and a bunch of beautiful German reds that are both unexpected and delightful.  Speaking of the Rieslings, their selection ranges from the traditional sweet and mineral wines to some surprisingly dry one also.  Last night, I had an amazing red - a blend of mostly Grenache, a little Syrah, and a little Mourvedre (an oft overlooked but delightful grape).  

While their wines are a bit pricier by the glass or bottle than what you might expect to pay at Good Oak or Congress, the quality in astronomically better.  If you're on a budget, ask for the house white or house red as they are always fantastic (and nothing like what you might expect of a house wine at a different establishment).",2013-11-14 18:58:32,Unplugged,118 E Congress St,Tucson,AZ,85701,32.2219630971,-110.969274044,4.5,0,1,0.0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0,0

First Southern and now Grace Meat + Three. By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!

I met my brother here for a ""cheat day"" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.

In order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.

Review:
Hot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  

BBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.

Fried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.

Mac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.

Cornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.

Greens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.

Conclusion paragraph:
I had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott.

All three were really good! It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal.

General disappointments: They were out of orange juice, diet coke, and to go boxes. Someone waited twenty minutes to order food to go and then overheard the staff tell someone else they were out of to go boxes and couldn't accommodate any take out orders. (I think all customers would have appreciated knowing upfront that these items and services were unavailable.)

Service disappointments: While our initial interaction with our waitress was seemingly standard and friendly, I can't provide any additional positive feedback about her because we barely saw her again.The waiter who brought us our beverages informed us of their lack of diet coke and forgot 2/3 waters. We spent over 35 minutes trying to make eye contact with our waitress to get her attention - and although we made eye contact, she never came over.

We spent 45 minutes waiting for refills on water and coffee (and of course our food), while other customers who had been seated after us and were simply sitting closer to the kitchen enjoyed their food. At this point I stood up and walked over towards the kitchen to request refills, and a different waitress said she would be right with us. Ten minutes later our waitress came over with refills and said our food shouldn't be much longer. 

This is now 55 minutes into our breakfast. (Just to be clear we all ordered eggs and the restaurant was not full.) While she was at our table we requested a set of utensils (since only 2/3 of our party was given a set of utensils when we were seated). In addition we requested salt and ketchup - because at this point we had high hopes our food would be arriving soon and our table was not prepared with these items unlike the other tables near us.

Finally over an hour after being seated our food arrived with unmelted cheese on the eggs and 2 packets of ketchup for our table of 3. When the waitress walked away we took the bottle of ketchup from an empty table nearby and ate our breakfast.

On the door walking in there are images of the credit cards they accept but when you walk to the counter there is a hand written sign that says something to the effect of we do not accept credit cards use the ATM next door. 

I told my husband we would need to go elsewhere to eat then. At this point some guy came up to take our order, we commented on the credit card thing and he gave ranted at us for a good while about giving away money because the rate was 3.69% per sale and he cant afford to pay it and the electric and this and that. Like ok whatever dude, you're in business as is the bank you agreed to their terms and conditions when you had it installed to run your business. 

He then handed us a menu and said we could order it off of the web from foodcab.net.

At this point I was pretty much over this guys bad attitude and wanted to just walk out of there but my husband was pretty upset as he really wanted BBQ so we ordered off line from the foodcab.net since we could use our credit card.

This is the best of the Schnucks in the city itself, although I have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there. The staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city Schnucks, which again is not really that hard to accomplish.

The selection of merchandise could be much better, for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet, apparently the locals don't care if they are 300+ lbs, as the managers tell me there is no demand for it. The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date.

The weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises. To the contrary, they seem welcomed, one even wears a Schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles, sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy.

I was a little disappointed to find out that you go up to the till, place your order and pay for your meal BEFORE you sit at your table.  So here is another situation where if you don't have cash on you, you are expected to tip before you have even had your meal.  

The one server that they had on staff that night was very rushed and I felt rather bad for her.  We patiently awaited our turn to order.  

You have a full view of the kitchen so that you can watch your food being prepared if you wish.  It looked like the cook took pride in what he was doing.  

There were two of us.  We ordered a batch of steamed mussels, the deep fried oysters and the seafood platter.  The oysters and the sampler are deep fried.  

Your meals are at least brought out to your table.  The steamed mussels were served in a red sauce, which I am going to guess had a tomato paste base to it.  The mussels were tender and the sauce was okay but it was nothing spectacular.  As you can see from the photo I posted, you are given a tiny sliver of bread and a single butter pat.  Dadeo's are much tastier.  

The deep fried oysters were really dark, they looked burnt.  They were juicy though and served with french fries and an in-house made seafood sauce. 

The seafood platter was again, deep fried.  It contained 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, 1 oyster, 1 cod & fries.  This was also served with an in-house made seafood sauce and no tartar sauce in sight!  White and malt vinegar is supplied on the tables.  The cod was overcooked to the point of being mushy and falling apart.  The rest of it was edible, but really plain.  

Billingsgate, you really need to bring the menu ordering back again!  It would have been nice to have more that one beer with my meal and it also would have been nice to have a server to ask for water and tartar sauce.  

I do need to note that the retail side of Billingsgate is quite nice.  The fish and seafood is all on ice in the coolers, or you have several frozen choices as well.  There is live lobster and crab in the tanks ready to take home.

My girlfriend and I have both never been here before. We've been trying sushi restaurants in the SJ/Philly area, usually about once a month for the last few months and so far all have been pretty good. Akira made no exception. The staff was friendly and prompt and we were seated immediately in the first dining area (next time we'll try the hibachi experience). The booth was very comfortable and we both liked the decor. 

We started off with the buttered fried calamari. It was so-so. The texture was a bit chewy and the breading wasn't very flavorful. The amount we received was also on the light side. I doubt we'll get this again next time around. 

For our entre, we ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, the Diga roll and the Eagle roll. All were excellent and the highlight of our meal. The smokey flavor and subtle mix of heat of the Diga roll was incredible. Get it. You won't be disappointed. 

The reason I'm giving this 3.5 stars and not a 4 is because the calamari wasn't very good and their prices are a bit steep for their specialty rolls. You can get cheaper prices and more for your dollar at Mega Sushi or Crazy Sushi in the city or Sagami on rt 130.

I- the introduction to the place was great as well! It was a sit yourself place so no hostess, but it took about a minute for the waitress to get to us and she was super nice and friendly. She was a great representative to the place.

S- the service was very good, it wasn't too long, or too short. The waitress filled out waters when it was empty and she asked if we needed anything. The only negative was she didn't ask if we wanted our pickles filled up.

S- the overall satisfaction was great. The food was great. I had the bacon and cheddar burger and it was cooked to perfection and the cole slaw was fantastic! The only negatives was the pickles not being filled up and the price was a little high, I don't think the price was reasonable.

A co-worker and I decided to try the Friday buffet which is seafood centric.   We had the arroz con pollo and shredded brisket; they were both full of flavor.  The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.  

We did speak with the owner after eating and he shared his background.  He couldn't have been nicer, and did allow us to try a few items off the day's menu (the empandas are not to be missed).   Calypso is a great addition to River Ridge, but helps fill the hole of Latin cuisine in the entire metro area.  I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu!

They are off to a good start. We were seated at a high-top by the bar, not my favorite spot, but it will do. The interior has not changed at all so it looks cool and urban and hip and classy-casual as usual. 

Our meals were very good and the food was all fresh and hot and very nicely presented. I had the Chicken Picatta and the portion was generous. The sauce was pleasantly lemony with capers all placed over a very nice menage of fresh corn and other veggies. There were mashed potatoes on the side. It was flavorful and nicely cooked. The chicken breast was tender and juicy.

The service was a bit uneven. We were given menus and he took our drink order after pouring the water. There was a bit of a wait getting our drinks.

After taking a walk in nearby Pennypack Park(including checking out the King's Highway Bridge), we found ourselves in Holmesburg. As it was too late to order from Jack's Place(as we usually do), & I remember bookmarking this place.

We ordered a large pizza w/ grilled veg. a veggie wrap, + an order of hand-cut fries. The pizza was very good. The veggies were onions, sweet & bell peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. They were briefly sauteed on a flat-top, so I guess that technically was grilled.They were mostly in the center of the pie however. The crust was good, as was the sauce, and ample amounts of cheese made for an above average pizza. Too bad it was cold by the time we got it home, which was only a five minute drive. So were the fries. They were tasty, not overly salted nor greasy. You get a huge amount per order ($5), but were pretty much soggy because of the huge amount piled together. The garlic parm aoili was O.K., could have used more garlic.You can get these fries as poutine, or w/ other toppings for an additional $1-4.The veggie wrap was standard, but decent. All this food was just over $30, which seemed a tad high.

An OK augmentation to our leftovers; I say this place has better than average pizza & fries, but is not so special as to want to return soon, or to try other stuff they serve.

Hadn't gone much in recent years, a few times. Decided to go the other day for a pretty important game to decide the teams who would play the World Series.

Place is much dumpier than I remembered it, but fine. Food was decently priced and seemed fresh enough for a dive bar. Bartender gave us good service as she had a bar full of regulars (at 3:00 pm on a Thursday afternoon) and we were the only table requiring service. 

Two things were problematic for me.

One: A loud-mouthed regular at the bar was blathering on about how he and his wife once walked down the coast in California and came across a nude, gay beach, and went on about how ""[expletive] disgusting"" it was, ad nauseum. Perhaps that isn't a problem the Home Plate can fix, I understand, having spent years in the hospitality business...you can't censor what your customers say. But I'm just mentioning it because if you bring your kids here to use the batting cages, they walk through the bar. The batting cages are in the outdoor area where bar regulars go to smoke. Where said loud-mouthed regular may be mouthing off as well. Is it a big deal? You decide.

Two: The bartender, although she was nice and gave fine service, was complaining about ""WHY is there still baseball in OCTOBER??"" Companion and I were like...you work at a place called Home Plate and are complaining about baseball in October??

There are much better sports bars in Tucson. We won't be back.",2013-10-24 05:46:51,Home Plate Sports Pub,4880 E 22nd St,Tucson,AZ,85711,32.206315,-110.887843,3.5,1,0,0.0,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Have to admit first impression wasn't great. When I walked back to the car I noticed there was water dripping from the bag! That must have come from the steaming of the meat. Luckily I caught it before I made a mess of myself.

I ordered the Firehouse Hero (Roast Beef/Turkey/Ham) which was one of the Specialty subs. There was a substantial amount of meat and the sub roll wasn't soggy like I expected to be. If you are hungry get a sub at Firehouse. I was feeling lethargic after finishing the sandwich.

Also interesting was the Coke Freestyle machine they used to serve soft drinks. You can choose from 100+ selections. I always get bored w/ the standard fountain drinks so the Freestyle machine worked great. Ended up getting a Diet Vanilla Root Beer.

Final Verdict: Steaming of the meats did bring out more flavor, and it didn't make a mess of the sub. And I might go back just to get a special soft drink.",2012-12-04 16:33:24,Firehouse Subs,5963 E 82nd St,Indianapolis,IN,46250,39.90473,-86.06554,3.0,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

I stopped coming to red lobster... due to the fact you can go to ANY steak & seafood restaurant... and they will charge you the same price for FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!   This was just sad!!!! Our bill was 110$ for 2 people and it was horrible.    I didn't order broccoli... but the servers had a large birthday party... so I really felt like they just rushed when with us.  I hate broccoli. When she brought out the food which was steak Nd a lobster tail.. she brought out my medium well steak that was cooked all the way thru. It was dry and flavorless.  And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree. For 10 mins my dry food sat on the table and got cold because it was disgusting and dry!       It was still nasty after I drown it in sauce. All I ate was the rice(that I had to ask for after she brought out the dry old looking broccoli) and the mash potatoes. Which we paid more for lobster Mac but was brought out the smallest portion I've ever seen.    I've ordered it before and never gotten a portion this Small.

(That is -- you'll feel heavier, but your wallet will feel a lot lighter.)

Stopped by here on a visit to Lumiere Place; figured it was worth a shot.  Didn't know anything about the pedigree of the chef or the place -- just that it was in the casino, I was hungry, and I was there.  Seated quickly (it was late in a Wednesday evening and pretty dead).  Server was attentive, patient to answer the questions I had, and was pretty efficient.

First thing you'll notice when you open the menu - yeah.  Pricey, even for a gourmet burger joint.  You can either build your own burger (starting with a base at around $10 and adding on for extra ingredients ranging from truffles and caramelized onions to good ol' fashioned bacon and cheddar), or pick one of the select ones.  Those come with fries, so there's a slight savings there, since fries are separate for the main burgers.

The fail here is that the burgers are about 75% the size of what you'd expect to get at the local burger hut.  That wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, except that the prices are about 25% higher than what you'd expect to pay at a gourmet/specialty burger place.  Yes, yes, this place is inside of a casino, so you'd expect it to be a little pricier, but it just seemed like it was a premium price for what turned out to be an OK meal.  

This is a place to stop by if you're going to spend a night at the casino with friends and want to have something fun and cool to eat before a night of gaming.  It's not a place to stop by after you're done and looking for something casual and cheap to end the evening.

I think the 3 stars is generous; the staff made up for this visit being kind of disappointing.  I can see where this place would be appealing; it just wasn't what I had in mind as a visitor.

The food menu looked really good, but it was under the ""coming soon"" section, so I was unsure if it was actually available last night.

Both places are quite similar, but FC had an air of pretentiousness that Boilermaker didn't.  FC was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas Boilermaker's beers and food were reasonably-priced.

Their beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery, Cabinet Artisinal Brewhouse which are mainly sour and/or really interesting beers.  I absolutely loved everything I tried.  One of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful.  We ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 bacon-wrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for $9 which is a pretty good deal IMO.

I had wanted to go to BST back in the day and never made it but it really hasn't been on my list for a while. When we got the invite I was glad to accept. Good friends,I assumed food decent at worst, so sounded like fun. 
The setting . Big warehouse style building between 2 somewheres. 4th floor overlooking quasi industrialish part of the river. The crowd. Well it is a bit older. Median age 60 or 60+. The restaurant. They take the space and try to make as many tables as possible by the window overlooking river. 
Ok let's get down to food. We were 4. Opposite husband ordered crab gallette. I'm not a big sharer with other couples. It did look good. Somewhere between a cake and a mousse. He finished it. The wife got the vegetarian app. Lots of good choices on the menu imo. I wouldn't order but whatever. I ordered the escargots with sauteed mushrooms and red burgundy sauce. Honestly if this dish were at Ela or Stateside they'd add a lil jazz and the hipsters would be going batshit crazy. This was a very good dish. Red burgundy sauce just matched with snails and mushrooms so well. It was a grab an extra roll to sop it up kind of sauce. And the snails were nice and tender. My wife got the cold local corn soup. Well executed but I'm just not a huge cold corn fan. Very summer sweet.
Mains. Opposing husband got the salmon. Looked ok. Seemed a bit better done than  I prefer but I struggle all the time with this. Sauce looked nice. I got a scallop dish with sauteed veggies, potatoes and a bouillabaise sauce. Very nice. Sauce excellent. Scallops cooked properly. Not a home run but good food. My wife got the home run. Hangar steak cooked medium rare sliced down and in a red burgundy sauce. Side of green lentils. Hangar was perfectly cooked and had that extra meaty flavor that a good hangar steak should have. Burgundy sauce they just do it right. Wonderful dish.
We didn't order desert.
Here's the deal. Apps were 10-12 bucks. My escargots were $10. That's crazy cheap. The entrees were $23ish. Good quality. $5 less than many places. Wine was all Moore Brothers stuff.. No trophy wines just wine meant to be good drinking wine with food. And reasonably priced
It's not on the hipster to do list right now. But the food is very good for the price and if you renamed this restaurant and reopened it in a different section of the city it might be packed.

I have to tell you this may be one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I have ever tried and because I travel for business I eat a lot of Vietnamese food in a lot of Vietnamese restaurants. Of all of them I like only one in Austin TX better than Pho Friendly. 
The broth for their traditional Vietnamese noodle bowls is rich, sweetish, and flavorful without being heavy. And their ingredients are super fresh. I'm a huge fan of Pho Tai Nam and the meats in this noodle bowl are just wonderful.
Spring rolls? Classic. They could not be better.
Dumplings? Better than any in any other Vietnamese joint I've ever tried.

I'm crazy about the two people who run this place. They could not be more friendly and helpful. 

The neighborhood is modest/blue collar but Pho Friendly is immediately across the street from a huge hospital//health center and there is a bus stop right there. I've never worried about being there.

There were 3 front of house/ managers floating between the tables checking out certain select customers, blatantly demonstrating that only a few customers were worth paying attention to.

To be fair our waiter was great, attentive & making sure we had everything we needed.  Only criticism for him was around not serving the lady first, but that seems to be the case in nearly all restaurants these days!

The food was ok, disappointing that we had not finished our starter before the main came to the table, our waiter apologized, but didn't feel like had much choice as would have gone back under the lights until we were ready!

Cuz, I aint met a mother fucker that can do that yet,
Trendsetter, I am better, my reviews they're good,
I got a gourmet palate that says ""You wish you could"",

When the Yelping begins, you know I gotta join in,
Zaikka gets a 3 star review, but I still call it a win,
Confit has arrived, so you better make way,
Ask any Yelper in the crowd they say ""the kid don't play"",

Other Yelpers can't win, I make em rust like tin,
Zaikka's Indian food is like a partial win,
Because their food isn't bad as can be, but you got my words on your screen,
I say their flavors are muted, like the color pea green,

The best Yelper that's ever lived, is Jeff Confit,
Killing this review, Zaikka's food is half whack,
The other half makes up for it, so I'll cut em some slack

Forever peanut butter eggs for Easter, never jelly beans!

Mark Bittman's in tears, take a guess who just made HIM cry?

I'll never retire, or put the laptop up on a shelf,
The baddest Yelper in history of Yelp itself,
Zaikka's food wasn't bitter or rad, so tell your Mom and your Dad,
You want a Yelp review give me an iPad, and an hour n half.

And eat em up like a curry, my review won't cheat 'em

Forget Oreos, eat CONFIT cookies!

If you are on Market street, it's maybe worth the stop,

CONFIT, I'm Bad, other Yelpers should know,
When I enter the the center, they say ""Yo, yo there he go""
Zaikka's bill ain't big, so use some cash or a charge, 
Yelpin so hard, this culinary bard, is forever livin too large,

The original Zot, just taking a shot,
Dropping reviews, like your butt on the pot,
You're a novice, I am noble, never biting my tongue,
The mad Hungarian, just declare that I've won,

My reviews are exact like a rack and pinion on a Jag,
When you order food from Zaikka, it's like a grab-bag,
They don't serve scavengers, like catfish, vulture,

A family friend mentioned the place a little under a year ago, soon after they opened up.  I was skeptical at first, but the food convinced me that the place is a keeper.  Everything is rich in flavor whether it's the burgers, the appetizers, or any one of the entrees.  Ingredients are mostly local as another reviewer said, aside from a few oddballs like their sharp Irish cheddar which is imported.  (Sent as the entire wax-packed cheese wheel as one waitress said.  Very classy.)  Draft selection is good.  Chips are fried in house, and they make their own ketchup which is nothing short of delicious.  (This is coming from a guy who doesn't like ketchup.)

Service is slow as someone else mentioned, but I imagine that it's due to the food being cooked mostly start to finish at the time of ordering for freshness.  (For better or for worse, it's usually pretty quiet.  Best to not to let ingredients sit out for too long by the prep station, waiting to be cooked, you know?)  It's not a bother though.

My only major complaint is the acoustics.  The restaurant is all hard surfaces, and it's amplified echoes galore wherever you are.  Don't go talking about your recent colonoscopy or workplace drama as most of the restaurant will hear it.  Also, they have themed nights. It's a nice idea, and some stuff looks fun, but Friday night--if I remember correctly--is live music.  When I was there, it ended up being a folk singer with a hi-top table of his homely, old groupies catcalling throughout every song in his set, perfectly timed as if it was a bloody live showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Loud, annoying, and truly dreadful.  In fairness though, that's what happens when you put live music and groupies in a small, resonant space.  Fortunately, the food was still good, and the show eventually stopped.

Anyway, go bring this place some business. The food is great, the drinks are good, and the waitresses are cute.  It's good stuff.",2013-02-21 21:48:04,Dolan's Irish Pub,630 Rt 130 S,Burlington,NJ,08016,40.0709453296,-74.8664188385,3.5,0,1,,,0,0,0,0,0,1

Our order was taken right away and in a friendly manner. The food seemed to take several minutes, but was hot and fresh and worth the wait. It was my first time trying the new veggie sliders. They aren't THE best veggie burgers I have ever had, and are quite high in calories from what I hear, but were good. I appreciate that White Castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat.

The only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce, what kind of sauce I do not know, I requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off. There also were no napkins or salt in the bag. It was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunt's fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car. The large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein.

Service was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean. It appears to be either a newer store or a very well-kept one. Bonus was seeing one of the Indy chicken limos down the road.

It's an established place where New Orleanians come for wings, Cajun fries, and the famous ghetto punch! It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.

After getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside. 

Personally, l think the wings are rather dry: they could use some juice or some oil to keep them juicy. The fries I love, but not more than I love the punch! Get a large if you can; you won't regret it.

I like the open lobby with lots of seating when you first walk in which is great for a quiet area to make a quick phone call or to wait for someone.  Closed to the front desk, there's a small display indicating what events are taking place in what ballroom.

Upon heading up the stairs, there's a hallway to the left or right leading to the rooms.  I have attended events in the rooms to the right.  The layout is great to allow for registration tables to be set up and the washrooms are close by.  The washrooms are nice and then have comfortable hand towels and the soap well stocked

The room was set up with tables and chairs and a podium and table at the front.  It's great there's a large screen for a PowerPoint presentation as well.  For the event, there was light food and beverages at the back of the room.  The staff were working hard to make sure the cups and plates were promptly removed and ensuring there was no shortage for people to use.

I walked in and was amazed at how small the place was. I counted around 15 seats total. The seats were a bit worn down and could have definitely used some cushions (I actually did hurt my butt sitting down on those things). I browsed through the menu, found my singer (and was disappointed at the up charge to have meat in it). So I watched as the lady behind the counter made my food.

While waiting I have to point out how immaculately clean the kitchen was. Having worked in several restaurants I know how much work it takes to keep a kitchen as spotless as this place was and I have to say that alone impressed me and told me that the people who own this place care. 

Once I got my food I figured, ""yep... that's a slinger"". I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more chili on it, and I felt that the chili and burger meat could have done with some seasoning. However that being said, it was okay for diner food. Not something I'd go out of my way for, but not something I'd avoid either. If the owner took the time to add a bit more flavor to the food this would be a place worth visiting regularly for me.

The rice was yellow (confirming the previous reviewer), the flavor was ok, it had chunks of pork which was gross. The pork tasted like it was boiled, no crispiness. The shrimp meal.... Hmmm where do I start, the sauce was so thick and gooey, I think he just poured a bottle of hoisin sauce and that was it. The veggies were so soggy, almost inedible.

But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.

My order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.

For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.

Their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are ""prepared with vegetarian ingredients"", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't.

A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! 

Upon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant

I let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. 

We ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. 

No tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all...

I love the little Trojan horse that's just inside the door (it's big, but ""little"" compared to the size of the original).

I've been coming here for years, and the good has always been great. The kabobs are awesome (I usually alternate between the chicken and spicy beef), and come with nice sides of Bulgar and vegetables. The pita bread is absolutely amazing, and is made fresh when you place an order - it's a great appetizer (I recommend the red pepper sauce, or the hummus). There's a meal for two people that's great to get if you haven't been to the restaurant before, as you get to sample a few of the dishes.

Last night we took 6 other couples to Sofra (8 of us total) - we lucked out as a group of 8 had canceled earlier in the day (reservations on the weekend nights should be made 4-7 days in advance). The other couples absolutely loved their meals, and said they'd definitely be back again.

I knocked one star off because I feel the prices of some things are a bit expensive. Their baklava, which is absolutely delicious, sells for $8, and you get 4 small pieces. Yes, I ordered it every time I go, but it's still priced higher than it should be.

I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the ""bulk"" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an ""order here"" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably ""F-ed"" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T.

Back then, I would have rated it 5 stars.  I've dined there recently (was craving a steak and was too far out from going to my usual favorite steakhouse which is located in another county).  It was a Friday night about 8pm and I was expecting to have to wait to be seated.  We were seated right away.  The restaurant was busy, but should have been packed for a Friday. This shows how the place has gone somewhat downhill over the years and more people are going to places like the Texas Roadhouse and Long Horn Ranch or Outback.  I ordered the delmonico steak (my favorite cut).  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked more like medium.  But I didn't complain.  At least it was still pink inside because I can not stand a steak that is too well done.  My meal came with two sides and all I really wanted was a baked sweet potato.  I declined the other side.  Our server was overly pushy about me ordering something else to go with it because ""I was going to have to pay for it anyway"".  I found her pushiness and comments to be a little rude but I let it slide.  My fiance ordered one of the specials, which included a filet mignon with a shrimp kabob.  The menu showed the picture featuring the kabob with chicken, shrimp and red peppers on the skewer.  When the order came, needless to say, it looked nothing like the mouth-watering picture featured on the menu.  There were five small shrimp (dried out looking) on the skewer and that was it.  When our server came by to ask how everything was, we gave the standard nod and then my fiance asked about the skewer of shrimp.  She stated ""Oh, well that's the way we make them here""....and that was it.  That was the LAST time she came to check on us except when it was time to get the check.  And BEFORE she handed us the check, she was very pushy about us ordering dessert.  We explained we were too full and that we would just take the check.  She continued to push until we finally said ""no, we really have to leave now"".  

My theory is that getting customers in to eat at Lone Star is not to issue, evidently RETAINING them is.

The food is expertly prepared and extremely creative.  They seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients, for example today I had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese, and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy. The mushroom tart I ate today was rich, buttery, and delicious. Of course, it's a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good.  They have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods:  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on Twitter and Facebook, it's haunting me and I might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow.  They also make their own bagels, which is super exciting for this born-and-raised-New Yorker.
